Lust for blood and treasureFactors such as the Federal Reserve’s decision not to cut interest rates this year, escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, and semiconductor stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) experiencing losses after sustained gains have contributed to this unease.According to former top US diplomat Richard Haass, despite these setbacks, the tough times in the market are far from over.https://finbold.com/investors-should-brace-for-worst-period-since-ww2-says-top-us-diplomat/ If you overvalue property to use as collateral for a loan and know someone in politics who could give you a heads up on insider trading info like Pelosi for example and her knowledge of a deal between the US government and Nvidia.The billionaire could use the loan money, as long as the profits exceed the total interest on the loan.Winning the game.21 April 2024GNOME Mutter 46.1 Brings Explicit Sync, Better NVIDIA Hybrid GPU Acceleration - Phoronixhttps://www.phoronix.com/news/GNOME-Mutter-46.1-ReleasedIs The AI Bubble Bursting? Wolf Richter's WTF ChartsIs it gold's turn now?John RubinoArtificial intelligence, which a few years ago existed only in science fiction (check out William Gibson’s Neuromancer), has morphed into an epic stock bubble. Nvidia, maker of the leading AI microchips, saw its market cap surge from $200 billion in 2019 to $2 trillion in 2023. I haven’t actually checked, but that might be the fastest episode of paper wealth creation in human history.So it’s possible that this sector got … ahem … a little ahead of itself. And last week it corrected brutally.Wolf Richer just posted some charts showing how bad — and widespread — the damage was. Here’s the AI part of his article:Nvidia [NVDA] plunged 10% today, to $762.00, the worst one-day plunge since March 2020. It’s down 21.8% from its all-time high of $974 on March 25. It became infamous here in this joint on February 24, when we honored it with a WTF Chart of the Year. At that time, Nvidia’s market cap had spiked to nearly $2 trillion, and shares to $788.We compared it to our WTF-Charts-of-the-Year of Tesla, which a couple of years later made it into our pantheon of Imploded Stocks, though its business continued to boom, and its Model Y became the bestselling model in the world. It just meant that the mania had begun to seep out of the stock.The minimum qualification for making it into the pantheon: the stock has to drop at least 70% from the all-time high. For NVDA to be inducted into the pantheon, the stock would have to drop to $292, and that’s not hard, that’s where it had been only 10 months ago. It was already a very high-priced stock back then. So today, we’ll honor it with a new and improved WTF chart of the year.But it gets funnier. I mean, look, you can’t take this stuff seriously.Super Micro Computer [SMCI] has been deeply tangled up in the AI mania by being one of the many vendors that build servers based on Nvidia’s GPUs. The stock collapsed by 23% today to $713.65 after the company skipped announcing the preliminary results that had been expected ahead of its official earnings results. At these stock prices, anything can trigger a get-the-hell-out moment. It is down by 42% from its all-time high on March 8 ($1,229).Over the 12 months from up to the all-time high, the stock had gained over 1,100%. This stuff is just hilarious. Kids having a bunch of fun or whatever. It has now given up 40% of that gain. This stuff shows just how silly the markets had gotten.Arm Holdings [ARM] plunged 16.9% today to $87.19. Over the past three trading days, it has plunged by 28.7%. The chip designer IPOed in September 2023. At the time, SoftBank had owned 90% of it, and it still holds a huge portion of it. In February, ARM had doubled in a matter of days:Read the rest here.Maybe It’s Gold’s Turn NowAI isn’t going away. As Richter notes, Tesla went through a similar correction but continues to dominate the EV market. This story is about the stock market, not the technology.And, okay, part of my motivation for posting this is schadenfreude. We commodities investors watched from the sidelines as insane amounts of easy money were made almost accidentally by people who didn’t see it coming (because no one foresaw the magnitude of this bubble).In a just universe, it would be gold’s turn to suddenly enrich its owners. Let’s see how that goes. https://rubino.substack.com/p/is-the-ai-bubble-bursting-wolf-richters?publication_id=1166121&post_id=143786210&isFreemail=true&r=pf5v4&triedRedirect=trueDeepL: Interestingly, the U.S. depends on the Taiwanese to produce cutting-edge semiconductors.TSMC (and Samsung) exclusively produce cutting-edge semiconductors.

Current projections for how much power AI server farms will consume are, well, shocking. From a recent Scientific American article:    Every online AI interaction relies on a scaffolding of information stored in remote servers—and those machines, stacked together in data centers worldwide, require a lot of energy. Around the globe, data centers currently account for about 1 to 1.5 percent of global electricity use, according to the International Energy Agency. And the world’s still-exploding boom in artificial intelligence could drive that number up a lot—and fast.    A peer-reviewed analysis published this week in Joule is one of the first to quantify the demand that is quickly materializing. A continuation of the current trends in AI capacity and adoption are set to lead to NVIDIA shipping 1.5 million AI server units per year by 2027. These 1.5 million servers, running at full capacity, would consume at least 85.4 terawatt-hours of electricity annually—more than what many small countries use in a year, according to the new assessment.Energy Stocks Are A Must-OwnTwo things are obvious from the above: First, we’re going to need way more power than we’re currently producing. Second, there’s no way we’ll be able to build that much new capacity in time. Shortages will ensue, raising the cost of electricity and the things necessary to produce it. So we should own the stocks that benefit from this trend.This Five-Stock Portfolio contains high-quality names in uranium, oil/gas, and copper (a metal that’s needed to move all those new electrons around).

With that in mind, let’s examine some of the financial fundamentals.In case you need to get up to speed, TMTG (as I’ll call it) is the parent company of Truth Social, the social network founded in 2021 by Donald Trump. In October 2021, it agreed to merge into Digital World Acquisition Corp., a blank-check company. Blank-check companies — or SPACs, as they are also known — enjoyed a brief moment back in 2021 as a way for companies to go public without much scrutiny of their finances. They simply merged into publicly traded firms with no operations that were sitting on a big pile of cash that investors had more or less blindly trusted the board to invest wisely. And reader, it often didn’t end well. By the end of 2023, at least 21 companies that went public through SPAC mergers have gone bankrupt. In total, SPACs lost investors — often retail stock buyers — some $46 billion from the peak of their valuations.On Tuesday, TMTG became a public company after its merger was finally approved last week. And when the shares started trading in New York with the ticker DJT, they jumped 42% to $70.90. That valued the company at $9.6 billion. By the close of regular trading, the shares had come back down to $57.99, which added about $650 million to Trump’s net worth because of his ownership stake, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Which brings us to the fundamentals. Based on that opening share price, TMTG is likely valued at more than 2,000 times annual revenue — taking the reported $3.4 million in nine-month sales and estimating for the year. Now, tech companies are often afforded generous valuations based on the assumption of rapid growth and the promise of future riches – or at least they were before interest rates increased.But let’s put that multiple of sales in some context: Nvidia Corp., the hit stock of the artificial intelligence revolution, is valued at just 38 times sales. When the preeminent social media platform of the past two decades, Facebook Inc. (now Meta Platforms Inc.) went public in 2012, it was valued at 12.5 times revenue. The only similar point of comparison that springs to mind is Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp, which at the time had little revenue to speak of, for $19 billion in 2014.WhatsApp did, of course, have a lot of users, though. About 450 million, at the time. TMTG doesn’t actually report the number of active users, though it said in a January regulatory filing that it has had “9.0 million signups for Truth Social via iOS, Android and the web.” Generously, each of those users is therefore afforded $1,067 in value. Meta is currently valued at $422 per monthly active Facebook user. It’s highly likely, however, that only a fraction of the signups to Truth Social use the app anything like monthly.And we haven’t even mentioned Trump Media’s reported $49 million loss in the nine months ending in September. All of which might explain why Trump Media is now the most expensive US stock to bet against, as Bloomberg News reported. There’s not much stock available (the number of shares being traded is pretty low), and lots of people think it’s overvalued. In other words, it’s a meme stock. —Alex WebbI have an older computer with an Intel I7 2.66 Ghz (4 core), Nvidia GeForce GTX 970, running Windows 10 and was curious what older version of Blender I should to dabble into 3d printing. Should I use Blender v2.92 since it was for Windows 7? Where can I find the system requirements for v2.92?I've been using Tinkercad but I'd like some advise about advanced software like Blender, GIMP or alternative software for 3D rendering. Thanks.@doppler00 That's what I do, I use the intel integrated graphics for hdmi audio.  Zero problems... except for intel bug that causes it to forget which channel is which (rare but sends the right channel to the rear? lol reboot to fix that one) 🤷If you have a desktop, setting nvidia to max performance isn't really an issue.  Don't really want to do that with a laptop though.I wonder if AMD has any issues. 😆 But like I said, the nvidia sound issues don't exist when the GPU is active, only when idle.  So it is fine when gaming.@BurntJello that is crazy. I guess not enough people use PCs for TV gaming with a theater setup for Nvidia to care. Wonder if it happens regardless of PCM or encoded?I could always route the audio through the integrated graphics HDMI port. Maybe...@doppler00 If you are using nvidia audio over hdmi, beware that their audio driver has a bug that causes buffer underruns (clicks/pops).  It has been an issue for many years and I doubt they will ever fix it.It won't be an issue playing games because the GPU will be active, but it can show up watching videos or listening to music.The workaround is to set "Power management mode" to "Prefer maximum performance".

The Swiss National Center for Scientific Computing is about to inaugurate an exceptional supercomputer, powered by Nvidia's Grace Hopper cards. These cards are delivered in small quantities by truck, under the close supervision of insurers. And for good reason: impossible to find stock, prices are soaring, 30 to 40,000 francs per unit. On paper, they promise to revolutionize the field by being able to train a model like GPT-3 in just two days."Hot, and hungry..."The processors will be cooled directly by Lake Lugano. The water is pumped to the bottom of the lake at 6 degrees. And that's an entire floor of piping that's needed to keep the computer from melting. By calculating, the temperature of the processors rises up to 90 degrees. Imagine 10,000 processors gathered in the same place !"-- our lakes have problems to cool down, mix oxygen, but nevermind..."But the most impressive thing about these supercomputers is the super consumption of electricity. The center is equipped with 17 transformers. At full capacity, it is the equivalent of a city of 25,000 inhabitants. “Today, consumption corresponds more to a village of 4000-5000 inhabitants,” explains Michele De Lorenzi, deputy director of the center. Note that all electricity comes from hydroelectric plants in the region."-- adding the consumption of a whole new city while crying about energy shortages, that for sure is "impressive"...#How to Buy NVIDIA Stocks in 2024Investing in stocks can be an exciting way to grow your wealth over time, and NVIDIA, as a leading technology company, is often on the radar of many investors.

You have a glitch on a gaming card it may have an artifact in a game on your screen. Workstation cards are designed for CAD and things. If you have an err there it can be a major problem. On the gaming front, I think it's best to get Radeon if you're buying new. If you're getting used, Nvidia can still be a good buy because of their fast processors. Plus, they have total manipulation of the gaming software. It's like this DLSS stuff. I have to turn it off. It looks like crap on the screen, and I start to get a headache.

However, there is good news: The White House announced Wednesday morning that the US Department of Commerce has reached a "preliminary agreement" with Intel to provide upwards of $8.5 billion in grants and as much as $11 billion in loans under the CHIPS and Science Act to expand semiconductor factories in the US. The Biden administration's announcement is not a surprise, mainly because Intel has struggled for several years in its turnaround plan. The funding will significantly expand the construction of Intel chip factories in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico, and Oregon."I Wish Upon You Ample Doses Of Pain And Suffering"“When Heaven is about to confer a great office on a man, it first exercises his mind with suffering, and his sinews and bones with toil,” whispered Xi to himself, contemplating the ancient wisdom of Mencius, born 100yrs after Confucius and considered Confucianism’s 2nd sage.“It exposes his body to hunger, and subjects him to extreme poverty; it confounds his undertakings,” continued Xi, alone on a long walk. “By all these methods it stimulates his mind, hardens his nature, and supplies his incompetencies.”Xi’s intelligence services had sent him TikTok videos of Jensen Huang, the founder/CEO of Nvidia, who spoke this week at Stanford University, in the heart of Silicon Valley. Jensen was born in Taiwan in 1963, his ancestors having escaped from the Communists all those years ago. His family made their way to Kentucky, where Jensen was mercilessly bullied by racists and worked at Denny’s where he washed dishes and cleaned toilets as he made his way through school.And now this remarkable man who in a parallel universe would have grown up as a Chinese national, is worth $80bln and built the firm which is leading the West into an unknowable future of artificial intelligence.“Greatness comes from character and character isn’t formed out of smart people – it’s formed out of people who suffered,” said Jensen Huang to the captivated Stanford students.I was fortunate that I grew up with my parents providing a condition for us to be successful on the one hand, but there were plenty of opportunities for setbacks and suffering,” continued Huang, his wisdom racing across social media. Xi sighed, increasingly confused, marveling at Jensen's wildly popular reception, while his directive to Chinese youth to “eat bitterness” had left them lying flat.“I don’t know how to do it for all of you Stanford students, but I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering,” said Huang, as Xi felt a growing sickness rise from within.https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/i-wish-upon-you-ample-doses-pain-and-sufferingSamsung to launch AI chips to challenge Nvidia, others — 'Mach 1' chips to launch in early 2025 | Tom's Hardware https://soundsnerdy.com/tech-news-main/top-story/samsung-to-launch-ai-chips-to-challenge-nvidia-others-mach-1-chips-to-launch-in-early-2025-toms-hardware/?utm_source=More curated Samsung news at http://SoundsNerdy.News#samsung #ai #Semiconductors #nvidia #mach1 #samsungMach1 #techNvidia and Amazon Upgrade Project Ceiba AI Supercomputer to Blackwell https://www.extremetech.com/computing/nvidia-and-amazon-upgrade-project-ceiba-ai-supercomputer-to-blackwell?utm_source=flipboard&utm_content=kevinbeachus9%2Fmagazine%2FAINvidia and Amazon Upgrade Project Ceiba AI Supercomputer to Blackwell https://www.extremetech.com/computing/nvidia-and-amazon-upgrade-project-ceiba-ai-supercomputer-to-blackwell?utm_source=flipboard&utm_content=kevinbeachus9%2Fmagazine%2FAIStruggling Intel Awarded $20 Billion In Chip Incentives For US PlantsFrom ZeroHedgeStruggling Intel Awarded $20 Billion In Chip Incentives For US Plants Over the past decade, Nvidia has surpassed Intel to become the most valuable semiconductor company in the United States.

The incident started around 4.55 a.m. ET, according to the exchange's website.Thousands of stocks are listed on the Nasdaq, including those of iPhone maker Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab, electric vehicle-maker Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab and artificial intelligence semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab.Technical glitches on exchanges can roil markets, hit traders' confidence and attract scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission.A glitch at the New York Stock Exchange last year prevented the opening auctions for a slew of stocks, prompting widespread trading halts, confusion over whether orders were being filled at correct prices and trades in more than 250 securities being busted.However, outages at major exchanges have been largely contained in recent years."The Nasdaq stock market has resolved its earlier matching engine issues and all systems are operating normally," the company said on its website. It did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.The exchange operator had reported similar issues in December, when stock orders were impacted and over 50 clients at the exchange were affected.The glitch on Monday impacted orders sent using the "RASH FIX" order handling system. FIX, or Financial Information Exchange, is a message protocol that defines an electronic message exchange for communicating securities transactions between two parties.The issue also led to self-help declarations against Nasdaq from Cboe (CBOE.Z), opens new tab and New York Stock Exchange Arca Equities, which specializes in listings of exchange-traded products.A "self-help" is a notification issued by a trading exchange when another exchange is dealing with internal problems processing trades and orders are routed through alternate venues.https://archive.ph/Sl9YZ@LibertyLuc Well, I wish Meta, Amazone, Nvidia, Tesla (stupid EV useless vehicles), Google, etc. would all make huge losses so we would be saved from these woke globalist slave companies ( I still am not convinced Elon Musk is a true anti globalist)CEO of Nvidia gives great 1 minute talk to Stanford students!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XOj3Omc9GY&t=99s&pp=2AFjkAIBWe are building the infrastructure of human freedom… BrighteonAI is the next launch that will put life-altering LLM technology into your hands for freeWait and see how quickly the government tries to ban it...Mike AdamsHere at Natural News and Brighteon, we are building the infrastructure of human freedom.Rather than building systems designed to enslave you, control you or maximize corporate profits by monetizing everything about you, we are building systems that empower you, inform you, inspire you and expand your horizons while enhancing your health.We started by launching NewsTargetcom in 2003 (over twenty years ago!). A few years later, it morphed into NaturalNewscom which reached hundreds of millions of readers with truth-based talk about vaccines, nutrition, health freedom, natural medicine and the dangers of pesticides, herbicides and prescription pharmaceuticals.After I was maliciously de-platformed by YouTube, we built Brighteoncom, which has become a widely recognized platform of free speech videos, where anyone can join and post free speech content at no charge.A few years later, we launched BrighteonSocial, which offers a free speech social media platform without the censorship of Twitter / X and Facebook. Then we launched BrighteonTV, a video broadcast platform, and BrighteonRadiocom for audio broadcast content.More recently, we launched Brighteon University at BrightUcom, which offers free educational content via video streaming, and it has already reached many millions of people with knowledge-based content.All of this is supported by our customers who shop at HealthRangerStorecom, loved by hundreds of thousands of customers who trust our lab-tested, certified organic, non-GMO foods, superfoods, nutritional supplements and personal care products, most of which we manufacture ourselves right in the heart of Texas.This year, we are launching two new projects that will profoundly benefit humanity. One of them is still a secret and we can't share details yet, but the other is BrighteonAI.Introducing BrighteonAI, a non-woke, reality-based Large Language Model (LLM) that's free to download and use on your own local computerVisit BrighteonAI now to register your email address to be alerted when we launch.BrighteonAI is the distribution site for our non-profit Consumer Wellness Center Data Science division which is building and releasing free, open source LLMs that are trained on reality-based knowledge for the purpose of empowering humanity.We've all seen Google's "woke" AI produce historically inaccurate images, where white people are replaced with People of Color (POC) -- a scrubbing of history that's consistent with Google's unstated mission of deliberately misinforming the world and disconnecting humanity from knowledge. And OpenAI has just added a new board member who used to work with Pfizer and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, underscoring the globalist, anti-human agenda behind OpenAI (creators of ChatGPT). Across the board, from Microsoft, Meta, Google, OpenAI and Amazon, the large corporate AI systems are being trained to lie about race, gender, climate, elections, vaccines, economics, history, science, pharmaceuticals and a thousand other topics that matter to our shared future.The answer to their lies and programmed misinformation is found in the open source LLM community where "base models" have been released that can be trained with new content and given new knowledge by any organization that has sufficient resources to build out a sufficiently large data pipeline and LLM training center (with lots of NVIDIA GPUs, it turns out).This is what we have done. We launched our http://Brighteon.AI project in the last quarter of 2023, and throughout 2024, we will be releasing numerous LLMs that are available for the public to freely download and use on their local Windows, Mac or Linux systems, completely free of charge and without sacrificing your privacy. These models run locally on your own hardware, and they can replace Google and other search engines for the vast majority of questions you might ask. Because they run locally (around 8 GB - 16 GB of RAM is typically required for your local computer), they even work if the internet goes offline. You do not need an internet connection to run these models, in other words.continuedhttps://healthranger.substack.com/p/we-are-building-the-infrastructure?publication_id=1225906&post_id=142701725&isFreemail=true&r=pf5v4&triedRedirect=trueBeamr Imaging has seen a 500% rally YTD with optimism surrounding its A.I.-driven video compression and optimization platform.

This also means a huge microchip boom is happening right now and new players and paradigms are starting to emerge to solve the problem of more compute. There are two issues that society has to solve, chip efficiency and chip production.  We are in the midst of a chip boom with only couple players in the market and they can only produce so much so fast. They also have many layers of proprietary red tape they have to deal with, i.e. licensing. However we have several types of new chips coming out now that solve one or both of the problems. Photonic, thermal, and various analog memristor chips are starting to hit the market.Rain Neuromorphic claims their chip is 10,000% more power efficient  but since it is analog there has to be a software system to quantize the analog signal to a digital signal so that it can interface with traditional architectures. They have the power aspect solved and potentially the manufacturing aspect. The company is using the RISC-V open architecture so they do not have to deal with any licensing. They also claim it is using nano-wires as the neurons on the chip. They didn't say anything about how easy it is to build but they did say that the chips do not need to be identical like traditional chips, variation or noise is tolerable. This had me thinking this could very easily simplify manufacturing and drastically increase manufacturing outputs. This is just one company out of dozens that are traveling down the same problem domain.If you are interested in where hardware is going here is a list of the key players that I have been following.Neuromorphic Computing*BrainChip Holdings: Develops neuromorphic computing chips that mimic brain processing.*Rain Neuromorphic: Focused on creating hardware for neuromorphic computing.*Intel Labs: Has neuromorphic computing projects, including Loihi, a neuromorphic research chip.*Hewlett Packard Enterprise: Working on neuromorphic systems and memristor technology.Quantum Computing*IBM Quantum: Developing quantum computers and offering cloud-based quantum computing services.*Rigetti Computing: Specializes in quantum computing hardware and software.*D-Wave Systems: Focuses on quantum annealing technology for optimization and sampling problems.*Quantum Brilliance: Developing diamond-based quantum computers operable at room temperature.Photonic Computing*Lightmatter: Develops processors that use light for processing AI workloads.*Optalysys: Specializes in optical computing technology for machine learning and simulation.*Luminous: Working on photonic computers for AI applications.Analog Computing*Mythic AI: Produces analog computation-based AI chips for edge devices.*Aspinity: Develops analog event-driven computing solutions for sensor data processing.Digital ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)*NVIDIA: Leader in GPUs for AI and deep learning.*AMD: Offers GPUs and CPUs that are widely used in AI computing.*Google: Developed the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for accelerating machine learning workloads.FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) and Custom Silicon*Xilinx (now part of AMD): Offers FPGAs that are used for flexible hardware acceleration of AI workloads.*Intel: Provides FPGAs and has acquired Altera, a leading FPGA manufacturer.*Graphcore: Produces the Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) for AI and machine learning computations.#FinancialEnlightenment#Bitcoin🤡#Gold 💰 ABOVE $2155 p oz#Silver 🩶 keep STACKINGEXPOSING #CRYPTOPeter Schiff exposes the truth about Shitcoin  & cryptos - Raoul Pal doesn’t want to hear the truth, much like the bitcoinheads & Nvidia heads.

Thanks though.@TrutherNurse  As I understand it, firmware is the current target point.  I've heard that nVidia created faux "open source" drivers for their graphics cards by merely offloading the proprietary sections into the cards' firmware.  We have to keep in mind we're dealing with corporations, the profit motives of which conflict with our desire for freedom.  And even if you use FOSS and open hardware, a sneaky bit of firmware can give away all your privacy without you even knowing.@Retro_Fan I'm no Nvidia fan, I'm still running on an old 6900XT, but the 4090 is a monster, credit where credit is due. The potential of the 5090 with GDDR7, a 512 bit bus, and potentially more VRAM would be impressive any way you slice it.I'm not going to pay the premium though. I could, but I can't justify it.On the AMD side, they are doing the same shit with FSR3 and frame generation.It's that time again for PC Gamers with the rumor mill on NextGen GPU's heating up. At least on the Nvidia side. The RTX 5090 looks like it could be a BEAST with significant performance over the  RTX 4090.I hope AMD has SOMETHING up their sleeve.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDBEgkkZh-QApple supplier Foxconn turns bullish on 2024 – thanks to booming demand for AI servershttps://macdailynews.com/2024/03/14/apple-supplier-foxconn-turns-bullish-on-2024-thanks-to-booming-demand-for-ai-servers/#Foxconn #AI #ArtificialIntelligence #Nvidia #AppleNews #Tech #TechNews #Technology"Humanoid robot startup Figure AI valued at $2.6 billion as #JeffBezos (founder of #Amazon and more), #OpenAI, #Nvidia join funding" by #nbcnews https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/humanoid-robot-startup-figure-ai-valued-26-billion-bezos-openai-nvidia-rcna141224RT #http://www.smukher2.eu #http://www.smukher2.co.uk #http://www.smukher2.com #http://www.smukher2.net #http://www.smukher2.org #smukher2 To #EMBL #EBI #UCLA #Everyone:This is great news, for indeed we need advanced AI and robotics to replace the callous workers of #India, the #BrentFogel and their lab types, #ElspethBruford #KristianGray and their lab types. Let me explain:Today I visited a medical center for a routine blood test here in India. The medical staff that took my blood said how "from now on they will extract blood with closed eyes", a joke right maybe but is it the right place and time for such a joke? When you have a patient at hand, who's not there for having fun but for your professional service expecting/trusting you will follow approved medical protocol and respect their privacy, are such jokes appropriate? If you want to make jokes go work in some comedy show what are you doing in medical profession?! These people should be fired. India ofcourse, has zero work culture --- India likes to blame disorganization and callous work culture, and everything bad to overpopulation, but we all know that's a lame excuse, because China has shown its possible to be organized and good work culture inspite of overpopulation (India and China almost same population or population density now). India is always on the wrong side of things, but even in US you have these callous medical staff. My former boss #BrentFogel #UCLA https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/brent-fogel#about and https://fogellab.neurology.ucla.edu/ who told me in so many words he "will make sure I never get another job". #BrentFogel, has lived up to his threat, I've been unemployed since I was freed from his job contract in 2021, the only job I got was a 6month contract in #EMBL #EBI in exactly same situation i.e. #ElspethBruford and #KristianGray https://vertebrate.genenames.org/ project/lab, a failed lab without funding about to close down who used me as scapegoat to shower their frustration blaming me for now fixing their crap research of 10years in 6months -- in between #StJude offered me a job rather a slavery contract that work by me, my students and any heirs will be their property and then they withdrew their job offer when I objected to such a contract, and let them know I will not work with #BrentFogel (they said because I said that about my previous employer they will not hire me). However, unlike #UCLA, the #EMBL #EBI closed that lab within a few months of my leaving, thus showing why #UK justice is still gold standard of the world, so now notice that boss' latest paper https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36380364/ she uses elspeth@genenames.org email id NOT the #EMBL #EBI affiliated email id elspeth@ebi.ac.uk (does not work as does not work there) that she had when she worked at #EMBL #EBI https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26842383/ (as funding and location of research was by #EBI #EMBL #CambridgeUniversity she has to put their name), here's an old article https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/jobs/career-profiles/elspeth-bruford but now she has no position in #EMBL #EBI, rightly so, cause all they did in the lab all day was abuse #EMBL #EBI and when I spoke up against such unfairness towards #EMBL #EBI they that day onward harasses me slack chat is evidence of this. #ElspethBruford #KristianGray and rest of lab got any no research done in years now I know why because they were callous did no work only chit chatted and abused #EMBL #EBI.Now getting back to #BrentFogel #UCLA and his lab staff, they did not limit their unprofessionalism to me. #BrentFogel and his lab staff who did patient genetic testing, used to say how they've found that a certain patinet's biological father/mother is different from whom they thought/stated their father/mother to be, and they will inform them this fact (it will be fun). A joke right maybe but is it the right place and time for such a joke? When you have a patient at hand, who's not there for having fun but for your professional service expecting/trusting you will follow approved medical protocol and respect their privacy, are such jokes appropriate? If you want to make jokes go work in some comedy show what are you doing in medical profession?! These people should be fired.  If not for harassment of me and Plagiarism which I detailed several times and also sent open letter to the authorities https://smukher2.eu/docs/This%20To%20Apprise%20You%20About%20Wrong%20Doings%20By%20Brent%20Fogel%20including%20and%20not%20limited%20to%20plagiarism%20by%20Brent%20Fogel%20and%20Dario%20Tommasini.pdf, if not for that atleast for medical malpractice #UCLA should fire and degrees should be stripped off from #BrentFogel and his lab staff, these people are a liability to not only #UCLA but to the whole medical and scientific community. This is also another reason why we need #AI #Robotics, its to replace the callous workers of #India, the #BrentFogel and their lab types, #ElspethBruford #KristianGray and their lab types."...

MANIPULATION WITHOUT END !--------------------------------------------------Bitcoin value overtakes the value of all silver worldwide with a new all-time high13:48- Finance100Bitcoin is rushing from record to record. With the rapid rise in prices, it is now leaving traditional investment products behind. Now silver has been hit.The Bitcoin price is currently experiencing unprecedented highs. The total value of the digital currency Bitcoin exceeded the value of all silver holdings worldwide on Monday. According to calculations by the specialist portal “Infinite Market Cap”, all Bitcoins were worth more than 1.41 trillion dollars (1.3 trillion euros) for the first time. The oldest cryptocurrency thus left behind the total value of silver ($ 1.38 trillion).The calculation is based on estimates that say around 1.74 million tons of silver have been mined worldwide so far. On Monday afternoon, Bitcoin was trading on stock exchanges for around $ 71,700.Launch of the Bitcoin fund attracts new investorsFor the rapid rise in the price ofBitcoin has recently been particularly concerned with large investors such as Grayscale, BlackRock and Fidelity, who have launched Bitcoin funds in the USA. These Bitcoin ETFs were approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in January. They allow investors to invest in Bitcoin without having to directly purchase or hold the digital currency itself.Bitcoin’s rally began last fall. Since the beginning of the year alone, digital money has increased by around 62 percent against the dollar. Gold tops the list of the most valuable investment products in “Infinite Market Cap”. Here the total holdings worldwide are ten times the value of Bitcoin (14.7 trillion dollars).Listed companies then follow in the ranking: Microsoft is in second place with a market value of $ 3.02 trillion, followed by Apple ($ 2.64 trillion) and the AI ​​chip manufacturer Nvidia (2.19 trillion).Bitcoin remains highly speculative - and can also lose value againWith the new Bitcoin all-time high, there is no guarantee that the Bitcoin price will continue to rise in the future. After the previous high of around 69,000 dollars on November 10, 2021, the price fell to below 17,000 dollars within a year, also because the scandal surrounding the criminal activities surrounding the crypto exchange FTX shook the confidence of investors.The strong Bitcoin price development is also likely to factor in an event that is expected for April 20th: the next so-called halving. The reward that Bitcoin miners receive for verifying crypto transactions is halved. Ultimately, the process leads to a slower growing supply of Bitcoin, which in the past has usually resulted in rising prices.https://www-finanzen100-de.translate.goog/finanznachrichten/boerse/bitcoin-wert-ueberholt-mit-neuem-allzeithoch-den-wert-des-gesamten-silbers-weltweit_H484823836_259749747/?_x_tr_sl=de&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=deFutures Drop As Nvidia Extends Slide, Japan Stocks Tumble, Bitcoin Hits $72,000From ZeroHedgeFutures Drop As Nvidia Extends Slide, Japan Stocks Tumble, Bitcoin Hits $72,000 US equity futures are poised to open lower on Monday, extending Friday’s slide into this data-heavy week after pulling back from all-time highs at the end of last week, with technology shares leading declines in the wake of data giving mixed signals about…Source: https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/futures-drop-nvidia-extends-slide-japan-stocks-tumble-bitcoin-hits-72000Discuss, share, promote & more: https://dissentwatch.com/boost/?boost_post_id=730879@DissentWatch"With the recent NVIDIA 550.54.14 Linux driver release the R550 series is now out as stable.

Last year, the only thing that supported the U.S. financial system and stopped it from completely collapsing, was investment into AI and the 7 technology stocks, referred to as the "Magnificent 7". Today, as we head into the last couple of weeks of the First Quarter in 2024, many of those "Magnificent 7" stocks are beginning to fall back from the AI bubble created in 2023, and there is now really only one of these stocks that has been basically stopping a full stock market crash, Nvidia, the leading manufacturer for the power-hungry computer processors needed to run AI. Nvidia is now worth more than all of these companies combined: AT&T, Boeing, Coca-Cola, Disney, FedEx, General Motors, IBM, McDonald’s, Nike, Starbucks, UPS, and Walmart. Nvidia recently reached a $2 trillion market value and has easily beat the previous most valued Big Tech company, Apple. Apple's valuation continues to decline, along with other Big Tech companies like Tesla, partly because of their dependence on the China market. And many investors are wise enough to see that Nvidia's current valuation is also a huge bubble that is going to burst. Besides Nvidia, the other "product" that is holding up the financial system right now is the new Bitcoin ETF that the SEC approved recently.by Brian Shilhavyhttps://healthimpactnews.com/2024/big-tech-capitalism-central-planning-and-free-markets-are-a-myth-as-the-u-s-financial-crash-is-imminentUpdate to my build (happy birthday to me)...These parts are on the way:Asus ROG Strix Z790-E motherboard. Hard to ignore a brand that I've had for well over 20 years that runs perfect to this day. Not one failure from any of my builds.Intel i9-3900KF CPU. There wasn't a huge difference between the 13900 and 14900 and like you said - put that difference on the GPU.Corsair Vengeance RAM (2x32 to start - more later if needed),Gigabyte Radeon 7600XT GPU. I read that the Gigabyte's have the least 'coil whine'. And it's a Radeon that I've used in the past with no issues. I've had my share of trouble with Nvidia.Crucial T500 2TB, SSD. It's a bit faster and $20 cheaper than the Western Digital I was considering and I didn't want to wait almost a month to get it.Corsair 1000w PSU. No worries about power shortages. EVER!Phanteks Enthoo Pro case. Huge inside. It will be fun trying to fill it!-I have not chosen a cooler yet. I'm looking pretty hard at the Noctua NH-D15. Thousands have bought it with excellent results, so that's hard to ignore. My only concern is it fitting this board. Some say they've had trouble mainly with their RAM slots getting crowded into. I'm looking at specs now. Pretty sure it will fit though.I also read somewhere that Asus recommends an AIO for this board and CPU, but maybe I'm too set in my ways for old-school parts? I'd like to try the AIO's but like most parts - just so many choices and just as many reviews good and bad. They are pretty much all the same except the pump. Obviously you don't want to chimp-out here. So do you spend $65 or $200 on an AIO?  Meh... maybe I'll try one down the road or if I find a deal I can't pass up. I even considered making m own cooler in my machine shop. That might be fun! Maybe use the parts from an old air conditioner. I've seen some people DIY these. Yes, WAY overkill, but what else can this retired machinist do for boredom? :) I always liked re-purposing stuff.I don't think I've ever had an old-school fan-type cooler ever fail. I think I had one with a noisy fan, but it was easily replaced. I've had more GPU fans fail than anything else. Usually dust contamination. Well, Plasma 6 was just pushed out on Archlinux.  Looking very nice.  Of course the default Wayland is causing issues with Nvidia GPU's but not near to the degree that it used to.  In fact, it is basically fixed.  Other than that, Plasma 6 is looking nice.

EVGA made great cards, but they didn't produce the chips, which put them (and others) in a tight place.".... Tesla’s been sliding all year. So has Apple. Microsoft and Alphabet have been struggling over the past month, but Amazon and Nvidia carried them all. Today, Apple plunged over troubles in China and pulled all the other leaders down with it, except Nvidia ... I personally believe it will take a big event to rip the momentum out of this market, such as a much bigger spike in inflation than we’ve seen that makes it clear to everyone that the Fed has a lot of work ahead of it still or another banking bust like we saw last spring. It’s bound to take a jolt, but once the momentum turns down, a lot will get pulled down with the sinking ship. That, of course, could happen this month as CRE troubles keep building and bank safety programs and reserve cash set-asides (reverse repo loans with the Fed) run out in March." https://www.thedailydoom.com/p/are-stocks-facing-a-titanic-crashYeah switch to Linux or Debian I am still using a computer given to me that was build in 2013 as my daily driver.https://www.techradar.com/pro/researcher-discovers-novel-way-to-double-computer-speeds-for-free-but-there-is-an-obvious-catch-and-it-may-only-work-with-nvidia-gpu-and-arm-cpu-for-now@FoxGibsonAgain Update: The AMD RX 6600 (featured on the right) plays dang sweet with Linux.

As the Theta engineering team continues its core development of EdgeCloud for its first release on May 1, a separate and parallel R&D track is under way to launch a pilot of the Theta Edge Node for mobile Android devices in the next few months.The goal of this initial pilot is to test the feasibility of leveraging up to 3.9 Billion active Google Android devices for certain types of AI computation workloads. Android today accounts for 70% of the mobile operating system market share across 190 countries, and provides an ideal platform to evaluate mobile CPU/GPU capabilities.This also sets up the opportunity to target over 150 million active Android TVs globally that run the AndroidTV operating system from Sony, Sharp, Phillips and many more brands. While the average daily consumption of television today is around 3 hours, this leaves the device available the majority of the time for other types of computation and data sharing, especially as these always connected Smart TVs increase CPU and GPU capabilities over the next decade.While intensive compute work is generally not feasible on mobile devices today, that is changing quickly. For example, TensorFlow Lite now enables on-device machine learning by allowing developers to run their trained models on mobile, embedded, and IoT devices and computers. It supports platforms such as embedded Linux, Android, iOS, and MCU. In the near future, these devices will be able to process more and more complex computations, and therefore become significantly more valuable as nodes on Theta EdgeCloud. Today’s devices can already run certain types of jobs on the Theta Edge Node, making the 3.9 billion Android devices worldwide a massive potential addition to Theta EdgeCloud. In the future, with the ability to serve GenAI, LLM inference, and text-to-image among other use cases, mobile devices running Edge Nodes can serve an AI market valued at $200 billion today, and projected to be worth more than $1 trillion in 2028.The opportunity is to shift compute-intensive AI workloads to the edge as the cost of centralized GPU resources skyrocket from all the major cloud service providers, but this remains a challenging technical problem. For example, NVIDIA recently announced a private AI chat bot for desktops running RTX on Windows PCs equipped with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 and 40 Series GPUs with at least 8GB of VRAM. Theta EdgeCloud when fully launched in 2025 aims to seamlessly integrate high-end GPU capability from cloud providers with billions of mobile and smart devices in addition to desktops and laptops into a unified AI infrastructure layer. This opens up a vast market to process on-demand AI workloads optimized for cost, quality of service, privacy and device capabilities.The Theta engineering team is excited to initially test with Google’s new experimental MediaPipe on device text-to-image generation solution for Android in the pilot launch of mobile Theta Edge node. The team is evaluating text-to-image generation based on text prompts using standard diffusion models as well as customized text-to-image generation based on text prompts using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights. “Creating LoRA weights requires training a foundation model on images of a specific object, person, or style, which enables the model to recognize the new concept and apply it when generating images,” according to Google developer site.The Theta team hopes you are as excited about this opportunity as we are, and invite you to participate in this pilot, share your feedback and resources as we continue to break new grounds in next-generation AI computing. As a final note, the initial expectation is that TFUEL staking will not be supported on Edge Node mobile pilot, and will be solely used for compute testing in this feasibility study.Theta Labshttps://thetalabs.medium.com/edgecloud-for-mobile-unleashing-ai-computing-on-3-9-billion-android-devices-7f07f02637f9"Current situation:1.

Usually, not always, but usually, if you see BTC rise, eventually people will take profit and invest it in altcoins, which in turn rise. Exchanges facilitate easy value transfer between cryptos, as it becomes more time-consuming to off-ramp and buy other financial investments like stocks.Crypto, as a space, is currently taking off. It hasn't exactly gone to the moon yet, but, like the last march of the ents, there's the notion that this could be the last crypto moonshot. Why? Institutional investment.Crypto is a relatively new technology. Most of its use cases have been relegated to "store of value" (like a black lotus from magic, it's valuable because enough people decided it is) or shitty NFT jpgs of monkeypunks. But what if the technologies were adopted to tangible use-cases? NFT's which prove titles and deeds and licenses? Perfectly auditable ledgers which processing fees are cheaper than credit cards at speed and at scale? Instantaneous cross-border payments with pennies in transaction fees compared to multiple days plus heavy fees today? Tokenization of existing instruments so that you can, for example,  but $100 worth of Nvidia instead of being locked out of shares without a decent chunk of change?That's the future of crypto - real world use cases. Those are coming online. It's inevitable as long as humans progress intellectually. Whether it's a flip of a switch or a gradual climb, it's coming. So, the best strategy would be to buy a little bit of everything shilled here, even psychopoasters' stinky linky, and spread out the risk of one not taking off while the rest of the market does.ICP, LINK, SOL, AVAX, CSPR, XRP, THETA, ALPH, PEPE even (personally I'm meme-coin agnostic but I can't deny I missed PEPE thrice). All and more will likely climb wildly as institutions come into the space, which forces more retail into the space, which drives prices up, and the late movers across Q4 '24 all the way to 2030 are buying our heavy bags and making us rich, because we have the tokens everyone needs to operate in the new financial world. It's literally just trying to determine which of all of them will have the highest multiplier.Those are the ones that become the Apple or Microsoft of crypto, and I think it's whatever one gets the most buy-in for tokenized real-world assets. Crypto as a whole is, what, $2T? If it captures 1% of the derivatives market, then it becomes valued at $12T. 1%. That's the moonshot of all moonshots, and it only fires once. (That's my schizoist rambling, but it's fucking dramatic, right?!)And BTC halving is a simple supply and demand: the rewards from mining are cut in half, the liquid Bitcoin flowing into the space is cut in half, holders hold, buyers want in, there's less supply, price goes up, econ 101. It's predictable and it's this year.WAGMIDistrobox 1.7 Improves NVIDIA Support, Wolfi Containers, and Adds New Flags"For those of you who like to run multiple Linux distributions containerized in a single distro, Luca Di Maio released today Distrobox 1.7 as a major update to this popular tool for running any Linux distro inside your terminal."https://9to5linux.com/distrobox-1-7-improves-nvidia-support-wolfi-containers-and-adds-new-flags#linux #lxer@AnotherDude Always informative and frequently entertaining.0:00 - Intro0:42 - Nvidia (NVDA) earnings report Q4 20241:56 - Apple says the iPhone 15’s battery has double the promised lifespan2:54 - Microsoft Will Use Intel to Manufacture Home-Grown Processor3:21 - Microsoft develops AI server gear to lessen reliance on Nvidia, The Information reports 4:24 - Apple Officially Warns Users to Stop Putting Wet iPhones in Rice5:19 - The top 7 bestselling phone models of 2023 are all iPhones6:18 - Intel accused of inflating CPU benchmark results 7:00 - AMD confirms Ryzen 8000G APUs don't support ECC RAM, despite initial claims 7:51 - Zuckerberg: Neural Wristband To Ship In 'Next Few Years'9:07 - Neuralink's first human patient able to control mouse through thinking, Musk says 10:10 - Cybertruck Engineer Addresses Claims the Tesla EVs Rust in Rain11:15 - Mercedes-Benz backs off plan to only sell EVs by 2030 11:40 - Reddit to offer shares in IPO to 75,000 of its most active users: report 12:18 - YouTube dominates TV streaming in US, per Nielsen’s latest report 13:47 - In a reversal, Apple is demanding 30% of the donations to meditation app Insight Timer’s teachers 15:30 - Cox Communications wins order overturning $1 billion US copyright verdict 16:05 - Nginx core developer quits project in security dispute, starts “freenginx” fork 17:03 - Nvidia’s finally replacing GeForce Experience with this all-in-one ‘Nvidia app’ 18:25 - Twitch warns US sub price increases “extremely likely” after international updates 19:05 - Vice Media stops publishing on website and cuts hundreds of jobs19:39 - Study finds anti-piracy messages backfire, especially for men20:19 - Snapchat isn’t liable for connecting 12-year-old to convicted sex offenders 21:27 - Signal Finally Rolls Out Usernames, So You Can Keep Your Phone Number Private 22:21 - Reddit reportedly signed a multi-million dollar licensing deal to train AI models 23:29 - Twitter security staff kept firm in compliance by disobeying Musk, FTC says 25:06 - India farmers' protest: X admits to taking down posts and accounts26:13 - X social media platform restores account of Navalny's widow27:30 - 90 Day Fiance stars criticized for fundraiser appeal after cancer 'diagnosis' from TikTok videos28:43 - RFK Jr. Wins Deferred Injunction in Vax Social Media Suit29:30 - Former Rep.

Huang argued that, even at this early stage of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, programming is no…@acapaaron You are correct, it all costs money.  However, you and I know the AI project is one huge sucking sound of resources, as AI really needs GPU processing.  Storage space is cheap, where 200 PB SSD system, if I recall correctly at one of my installations was around $40,000, compared to an Nvidia DGX GPU install was around $21,000,000 for 32 GPU nodes, and around $67,000,000 for 126 GPU nodes system.  Each GPU is around $400,000.  Power for the GPUs are 6kW, with another 3kW for supporting equipment per GPU node.  The power a node uses in a day is far more than most people use in a month in their housing, except for maybe Gore.  Here is the issue, his AI is a novelty, which many on this platform could not give a rat's ass about. The storage excuse is a specious argument, for it is truly cheap.  Frankly, his ego will chase people away where advertisers cannot justify the expenditure, in an attempt to justify and support his AI adventure.@Marisa216 @shanna37flint @a Seriously, he was spewing specious arguments.  Storage is CHEAP, where 200 PB (i.e., 200,000 TB) SSD hardware is in the $40,000 range, and not very power hungry.    As an idea, for comparison, AI computing power is extremely expensive.  Temporary gigs I have installed Nvidia DGX GPU server systems, from 32 to 126 GPU nodes.  Each GPU node is roughly $400,000, then depending on configuration, the support equipment is another $100,000.  Then there is the power, where the GPU uses approximately 6kW, plus another 2-3 kW for each support system.  Thus, each GPU uses as much power in a day than many houses use in a month.  The power costs are through the roof!!!  Standard server farms are nowhere near as expensive, both in hardware and power consumption.  Here is another fact, Gab limits sizes of files, which reduces total storage size.  I would wager, Gab has not exceeded 1 PB.  In conclusion, when @a starts yammering on about cost, look to the AI portion, as it is very expensive, not the storage.What did Naughty Nancy know and when did she know it...

This is the miracle of artificial intelligence"https://www.techspot.com/news/102020-nvidia-boss-jensen-huang-children-shouldnt-learn-code.htmlThe worlds leading tech CEO says humans no longer needed in coding/tech, AI has made them obsoletehttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/nvidia-ceo-claims-nobody-needs-to-learn-to-program-anymore-thanks-to-ai/ar-BB1iVzuzRecent statements by Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, have added fuel to the more than hot debate about artificial intelligence and how it can replace or delete jobs like that of a programmer. Huang, co-founder of the company, is clear: In the near future no one will have to program anymore, since AI will do almost everything for us.According to the CEO of Nvidia, in the future no one will have to programThese statements have been controversial and have both supporters and detractors. The reasoning of the director of the technology company is that, while a few years ago personalities in the sector have recommended that children learn computing and programming, Huang believes that in the future it should be the opposite. He said that “It is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human”, and instead, he recommends that new generations become experts in any other specialized subject.According to Jensen Huang, Artificial intelligence will reach a point where professions such as computer programming will be redundant before the tools and facilities that AIs will offer. The CEO of Nvidia believes that the ideal is that, given the emergence of these tools,there are more experts in any other field such as education, biology, or finance, as thanks to the refinement of artificial intelligence they will be able to be more efficient in their work and research.As we mentioned above, these statements have both supporters and detractors. Several of those who are in favor simply agree with him, while those who are against provide arguments such as that”the fact programmers are highly paid is a bug corporations will try to fix with automation even if the end result is lower quality.” Others directly mock Huang’s point of view as if someone in the Middle Ages claimed that “Thanks to the printing press, children will be able to stop learning to write”.What Huang’s statements do not take into account is the fact that learning any programming language is not only useful for the result itself, but it also has positive influences for programmers such as developing problem-solving or improving syntax capabilities.In mid-February 2024, Nvidia became the fourth most valuable company in the world overtaking giants like Alphabet (Google) and Amazon, thanks to their hardware intended for other large technology companies focused on the creation and research of artificial intelligence. This, according to many, would be another of the main reasons for Huang’s statements, since the ulterior motive for these statements would be precisely to please their investors and shareholders.Gravitas | Nvidia worth more than the GDP of Russia | WION.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5yy2EntvNcGreat Storyhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/yourmoney/consumer/article-13118197/jensen-huang-tech-nvidia-ceo-ai.html#newcommentFrom minimum wage at Denny's to $2 TRILLION colossus of the AI revolution and a $44M mansion on San Fran's Billionaires' Row - the extraordinary immigrant story of tech genius on course to be the world's richest manPelosi [D-CA] profits from insider trading https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelosi-husband-made-over-1-25-million-nvidia-stock-bet-just-three-months.amp?utm_source=GeorgiaLogCabinRISE OF THE ROBOTSBezos and Nvidia invest in humanoid automatons.Jeff Bezos, Nvidia, and other major technology players have reportedly invested $675 million into Figure AI, a startup building human-like robots.Figure AI’s humanoid robot under development is called Figure 01 and is intended to mimic both the appearance and movements of an actual human.

The result: a profit equivalent to six years' worth of Nancy’s salary.https://t.me/llordofwar/297540-Alarm Bells: Pelosi’s Huge Stock Trades Spark Serious Concerns!ormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is making headlines for reaping substantial financial gains from her stock trades, particularly her investment in NVIDIA (NVDA). In a remarkably short period of 92 days, Pelosi amassed a profit of approximately $1,800,000, equivalent to ten years’ worth of her political salary of $175,000 per annum. This substantial return on investment has intensified scrutiny, with questions arising about the potential influence of Pelosi’s political position on her stock trading decisions.Pelosi’s knack for strategically timed stock trades has prompted concerns, suggesting the possibility of leveraging insider knowledge derived from her political role. In 2023, her investments yielded a remarkable 65 percent return, outperforming the S&P 500’s overall gain of 24 percent. Such disparities fueled calls from within her own party to advocate for a ban on stock trading by congressional members. Despite initial resistance from Pelosi, the push for such a ban led Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) to introduce the PELOSI Act, aiming to prevent elected officials from owning securities and investments. However, the bill is yet to secure passage.Pelosi’s considerable wealth positions her as one of the most affluent members of Congress, boasting a combined net worth of around $46 million with her husband, Paul. While Pelosi contends that stock discussions do not occur with her investment banking spouse, revelations from video footage in her daughter’s documentary suggest otherwise, indicating that Paul is frequently present during her business-related phone calls.The intersection of political influence, financial gains, and calls for legislative restrictions underscores the ongoing debate surrounding the ethical considerations of congressional members engaging in stock trading. The conservative perspective on Pelosi’s financial maneuvers emphasizes the need for transparency and ethical conduct among elected officials to maintain public trust.https://con-alerts.com/alarm-bells-pelosis-huge-stock-trades-spark-serious-concerns/First off, GDP is annual added value, next year they have the same one or bigger... a countrys assets are ludicrous and almost unmeasurable, the regular land assets alone are quadrillions. This is why its nuts for Ukraine to sell its land to blackrock for $1 an acre.Second, stock value isnt real value. Eg if nvidia sells 10% stocks, the remaining 90% are worth less, because any sale of stock signals that the stock is worth less. And the crash is not linear, its geometric. Eg selling the next 10% off will make the 80% thats left reduce in price per share MORE than selling the first 10%. It wouldnt be weird if only a fraction of the original company value is extracted.This is why Elon was fucking nuts to buy twitter like he did. The cheaper way to do it is slowly over years buy the largest single piece, and always vote for the worst decision so the stock plummets, then buy up the rest slowly at a lower cost. Thats what the kikes do anyway.The real value of a company can be something like the physical assets, the profits for 2.5 years, and a reasonable estimate of stock value if sold, minus all of the liabilities.So if it really wanted to, Nvidia could conquer Ukraine and bring down the Gay American Empire.

I love it when a plan comes together. Mid morning of this past Tuesday, Feb 20, 2024 I posted that both Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) had taken a hit and both had their price per share drop in price. I recommended considering both for purchase. At the close of business Friday, AMD was up $11.00 +/- and NVDA was up $98.00 +/- per share and NVDA. Latest price target for AMD is $270/ share with NVDA at $835.00 /share (although some project the target of $1,000.00/ share) indicating both have more room to increase in value (price). Buy on weakness, but only in increments of 35% maximum of what your gut says. “Limit Orders” only. Do your own research and if it doesn’t fit your investing profile, don’t buy it.
