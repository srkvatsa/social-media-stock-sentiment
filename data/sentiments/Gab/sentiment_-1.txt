Obviously with AI, it can "calculate" what SHOULD happen vs what is happening hence why GPU manufacturers who have kinda hit Moores Law Limit are all over it. "Frame generation" magically made old 5-10 year GPU's increase FPS in modern games by 3xWith AI, it can artificially boost "FPS" an smooth things out to the point it can boost performance by 50XNow................imagine AI in about 5, 10, 20, 50 years..............AI would be so smart, you couldn't comprehend it but it would be mindlessly obedient to it's master and would have ZERO morals, or "ew factor" like say orchestrating a genocide or something.AI could craft endless perfect EVIL schemes. From rigging stock markets, an massive political propaganda campaigns to manipulate social media, psychological warfare far beyond what you could possibly comprehend. It's already happening but now it would be impossible to sniff out the bullshit.Remember that FAKE Julian Assange interview where they slipped up cause the cuff of his collar "warped", of those FAKE President gatherings where Obama & Biden weren't actually at the Veterans Graveyard outside DC.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbWe5k4fFWEIs a Topping Market A Sign Of An Impending Recession?

I've have so many problems the last years. systemctl, lightdm, could never get nvidia to work with wayland, tried to get lvm/qemu to do something useful for over a year. Weeks looking for answers on the internet. Eventually, I did a fresh install. Some things got better, other got worse. Still no nvidia with wayland. A weird lag appeared when I type in gnome-terminal. I'ts just too much.Windows appeared in weird places and if I tried to move them, the UI hangs for 5-10 seconds.Now, during my last attempt to get amdgpu driver to work, I lost the ability to run a graphical desktop completely. apt/dpkg have not been friendly.Luckily, I decided to dump LVM and go for a double-boot so now it's 100% Windows 11. It sucks in so many ways but it is predictable. No surprises except the occasional malware to deal with. don't think it's my hardware (ProArt X670E-CREATOR, Ryzen 7, 8700G, 96G RAM.)I have developed apps that only work on linux so not being able to use Linux is a major setback. Debugging GTK4-apps under MSYS2/mingw64 is a complete nightmare but at least I get something done. I've spent a week last two month trying to fix stuff under linux but nothing works. The GTK4 gang completely broke me when they switched to the new renderer, so there's that. At least under windows, the GTK4 stuff is in msys2/mingw so that's a bit of a sandbox that lets me go on.#China #AI #Semiconductors #Hypersonics 'Tech war: how Chinese scientists rigged a low-cost AI computer chip to power a hypersonic weaponUsing a Nvidia module widely available online, Chinese researchers overcome significant obstacles to boost performance of hypersonic vehicleJetson TX2i chip installed in the scramjet engine control system boosted range, stability and significantly cut research and development costs...'https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3259166/tech-war-how-chinese-scientists-rigged-low-cost-ai-computer-chip-power-hypersonic-weapon@TheMightyMax I've been running the same install since at least 14.04 but maybe even earlier. Eventually, things got so bad that I now decided to make a fresh install (24.04 beta)  and go with that. Results are terrible. To begin with, I have a lag in gnome-terminal. I cannot get NVIDIA drivers to work with Wayland even though wayland is the default as much as I understand. Eventually, I cannot even boot and login. Graphics just crashes. I'm just so tired of messing around with tyring to get things to work. Windows appearing out of view. Enough.The fact that they ship GTK4.14 got to me as well.There's officially used Instinct data center GPUs on the market for $600 with 32 GB of VRAM.AMD had better quit cheaping out on their consumer cards VRAM by just mirroring what Nvidia does. They don't have the data center cushion Team Green does.

But unfortunately not on tap, in cans.From Forbes: (Something A Leftist Would Never Understand)“I wish you ample doses of pain and suffering.”That is the unconventional message Nvidia CEO and founder Jensen Huang had for students at Stanford University, his alma mater, where he spoke last month at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.According to Huang, elite educational pedigrees alone are not necessarily the best predictor of success.“Greatness is not intelligence. Greatness comes from character. And character isn’t formed out of smart people, it’s formed out of people who suffered,” said the Stanford alum.Taiwan - Earthquakes & semiconductors ....Semiconductors power everything we do, from driving our cars to talking on our smartphones - even our military defenses, weapons systems, and airlines. - Everything uses chips. - A production halt would be bad for the global economy.Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) manufactures 80% of the advanced chips that power smartphones, electric vehicles, and cutting-edge AI tech like ChatGPT. - It is one of the world’s most influential companies. - However, it is located in Taiwan, where a recent earthquake reminded investors of the fragility of this island’s supply chain.Following a 7.4-magnitude earthquake last Wednesday, TSM said impacted facilities would resume production the next day. - However, certain production lines could take months for automated production to resume.Some of the high-end chips need 24/7 seamless operations in a vacuum state. So, even an hours-long shutdown of certain chip production could take weeks to recover. - Barclays analysts noted that “operation halts could mean some high-end chips in production may get spoiled.” - The bank estimates TSM could lose $60 million this quarter from the disruption.However, it’s not just TSM that suffers. - Hundreds of companies relying on TSM’s chips — including tech giants like Apple, Nvidia, Broadcom, and more – also risk production problems that could tank earnings, just like in 2021 when chip shortages cost automotive companies up to $200 billion.Taiwan has always been prone to earthquakes because it’s near the convergence of two tectonic platesQ NEWS OFFICIAL TV #WWG1WGA 💛🇺🇸Report: Unethical trans-human experiments at Wuhan Institute of Virology go beyond gene therapies and gain-of-function researchhttps://www.naturalnews.com/2024-04-07-unethical-trans-human-experiments-at-wuhan-institute.htmlhttp://NaturalNews.comReport: Unethical trans-human experiments at Wuhan Institute of Virology go beyond gene therapies and gain-of-function research…Unethical trans-humanist experiments, including the creation of chimeras and interspecies hybrids, have been conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), with the purported goal of achieving biological super-intelligence for population control and…2.4Kviews03:26Q NEWS OFFICIAL TV #WWG1WGA 💛🇺🇸Ukraine will JOIN NATO, Blinken announces, signaling imminent WWIII with Russiahttps://www.naturalnews.com/2024-04-05-ukraine-joins-nato-blinken-signaling-wwiii-russia.htmlhttp://NaturalNews.comUkraine will JOIN NATO, Blinken announces, signaling imminent WWIII with Russia – http://NaturalNews.comIn the clearest indication yet that the planet is on the verge of being plunged into another world war, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has stated that Ukraine will, in fact, be joining NATO.

But, the overall strategy is plain stupidity. Sanction Nvidia's A100 and 800 (top end) and it produces H100 & 800 for the evil rats.

Costs next to nothing. Whatever detour the rats use to acquire the microchips once they use them in ratland you can remotely shut down the microchips. This should help. It makes life more difficult for them as they have to use them out of ratland. COMPLETE decoupling, from socks to microchips to foreign students to immigration, if you know what commies fake china is about, its intentions, mindsets....etc. Kick commie Biden & his actors bunch out too, that goes without saying. 🔔 𝑵𝒗𝒊𝒅𝒊𝒂 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝑨𝑰 𝒄𝒉𝒊𝒑 𝒔𝒕𝒐𝒄𝒌 𝒓𝒆𝒎𝒂𝒊𝒏 𝑻𝒐𝒑 𝑷𝒊𝒄𝒌𝒔 𝒂𝒕 𝑩𝒐𝒇𝑨https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/nvidia-and-this-ai-chip-stock-remain-top-picks-at-bofa/ar-BB1kSJgO@KariLake @MiltonWolfMD @DrSimoneGold @realdonaldtrump @RepMattGaetz @RepAndyBiggshttps://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/bill-gates-dumps-stocks-in-42-billion-portfolio-nvidia-soars-again-and-newmont-corporation-crashes?post=433507Bill Gates Dumps Stocks In $42 Billion Portfolio, Nvidia Soars Again, And Newmont Corporation Crashes📰 💥 BREAKING 💥 : Monday, Apr 01 2024 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯NVIDIA buys Xbox from Microsoft: next-gen Xbox has dual GPUs, AI to fight and crush PlayStation 6https://www.tweaktown.com/news/97253/nvidia-buys-xbox-brand-from-microsoft-next-gen-has-dual-gpus-ai-to-fight-playstation-6/index.htmlJust a reminder, Martha Stewart and lots of NORMAL people have gone to prison for what Nancy and Paul Pelosi do every day.

The law bans the government from purchasing PCs with Intel and AMD ﻿chips inside, along with software products from Microsoft, including its Windows operating system.According to The Financial Times (via PC World), the new rules on purchasing products for China's government PCs were set in place in December by the country's Information Technology Security Evaluation Center. They include all governments and agencies above what is considered to be the country's township level.China previously ordered its government offices and agencies to no longer use Microsoft's Windows OS in 2022, in favor of a homegrown Linux-based OS. As a result, these new guidelines are not expected to affect Microsoft. However, the ban on Intel and AMD chips could result in a noticeable hit in the revenue numbers for both companies.On the other hand, the ban on these products on China's government PCs does not include their use in private businesses or by regular consumers in that country.China previously banned the use of Apple's iPhone products in its government buildings. It has also banned the use of products from Micron Technology for its infrastructure projects, citing security concerns.These new moves come sometime after the United States government banned China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) from exporting fabrication equipment to make certain chips in that country.Late in 2023, the US government banned the export of some of Nvidia's AI GPUs to China. Nvidia has instead developed AI chips, the H20, that were specifically made to conform to the restrictions of the US government's export rules. The company started taking preorders for the H20 chips in early 2024, and are expected to begin large scale shipments of those China-specific AI GPUs sometime in the second quarter of 2024.https://www.neowin.net/news/chinas-government-will-no-longer-buy-intel-or-amd-chips-or-microsoft-products-for-its-pcs/Computers will DESTROY Humanity!😱https://www.naturalnews.com/2024-03-25-nvidia-super-computer-ai-robots-control-world.htmlNo fight, after many years of not paying attention, watching everything I grew up with systematiclly destroyed and my ancestory reviled; my first thought now is how are they going to use this for evil and power control.  Totally agree there.In my option, the LLM is silicon valley's cold fusion. Lot's of money will be burned on this looking for it to surplant large swaths of white collar jobs. The problem is it's not creative all. It's only regurgitates what it's ingested. Any business that uses this tool for running critical business functions will stagnant, if they can keep it from being taken over via clever hacks.Right now the only people making money on this tool is Nvidia and other GPU manufacturers. The rest is a bonfire of stacks of money, a la Joker.Plus like crypto this all hinges on a solid electrical supply and we are doing a good job of shooting the economy in the chest with the forced transition to green energy.One positive case is LLM teachers by subject for home schooling. Best case is another silicon valley collapse wiping out 80% of the crap, including LLM "investments". There are enough open source tools to survive a collapse as long as we have functioning electricity. Are people trying to use this tool to summon demons? Yes, and it won'tbe the last tool they try that with. Will they succeed, doubt it. And they'll poison their own souls along the way.Didn't mean to turn this into an effort poast, there's a lot to unpack here and need some whiskey and a fire pit to have a quality conversation.210,000 CODERS lost jobs as NVIDIA released NEW coding language.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Y0ILHwwaMTRENDING RIGHT NOWChina Blocks Use of Intel, AMD Chips in Government ComputersFrom InfowarsWhile China is blocking the US-branded chips, the US still uses Chinese-manufactured chips in it’s systems.

After being condemned by the un for genocide.Vax data out......17 million dead................from vax confirmed.I have a few UPS units here at the house.  One on my desktop, one on my server, one for the "entertainment" system (flat screen tv, Blu-ray players, a/v receiver, Nvidia shield), and one on the computer in the kitchen.The one in the kitchen is an APC Back-Ups Pro 500 that I bought in 2002 at CompUSA when they were still around.   Of the almost 25 years I've had it there were maybe 8-10 where it wasn't plugged in and had no battery in it.  I'd upgraded to a Back-Ups Pro 1500.  The 1500 eventually died (capacitors on the circuit board went bad) so it was scrapped and replaced by one from CyberPower.Most of these units have had their batteries replaced at least once, some several times.  On average I get maybe 2 to 3 years out of the batteries.  It really depends on how often there are major power issues where the unit ends up running for an extended time as opposed to kicking in for a minute or two for a "brown out."We have a rack mount unit from APC at work, I've replaced the batteries on it 2 or 3 times over the last 6 years.  It takes eight 12V batteries that are wired up as 2 groups of 4 batteries in series with the two groups in parallel.  The battery assembly for there is in a metal tray that can be hot swapped from the UPS when needed.To get a spare tray and batteries with all the wiring was around $500 when I checked on it back in 2019 or so.  Pulling the batteries out of the tray and making a run over to Batteries and Bulbs got me 8 new batteries for about $250 or so.  Just did them again a couple months back and just the batteries ran me around $375 this time.I've been doing the same thing with my home units going back into the early 2000s.  I pull the battery pack, figure out what connects to what, what parts I need to keep, etc. then run the old batteries over to Batteries and Bulbs to recycle as I buy a new set.You don't have to buy your batteries from the manufacturer and you don't need to pay for the wires, mounts, connectors, etc. that come with their battery pack.  You already have all that crap on your old battery pack.I did a little hunting around on YouTube and this is one of the better videos I've found showing what I'm talking about.  The guy pulls the battery pack, separates the batteries from the wiring and connectors, and swaps in new batteries.  All you really need is a little time, maybe a pair of pliers and a screwdriver, and a roll of duct tape or electrical tape.  Take the old batteries to whoever recycles them and get however many you need with the equivalent specs to replace them.I've been running the Duracell equivalent of the OEM batteries on my units here for many years with no issues and they don't cost me anywhere near what ordering the entire battery pack from the manufacturer would.I just finished replacing the single 12V battery in the Back-Ups Pro 500 in the kitchen today and thought I'd pass some of this information along to maybe save some of you a few bucks too.  Even a small battery back up that gives you time to shut things off properly when the power goes out is useful and they also double as surge protectors.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycm6snFAbjQIf you want a seriously fast desktop PC - and you're spending someone else's money - Dell's Precision 7875 might suit.

Hotelhttps://telegra.ph/anti-genocide-protesters-march-inside-bidens-san-francisco-hotel-02-23@Riddler73 A bit of geopolitics.America sold its soul to China to bring down the Soviet Union.It had the petrodollar in place (dominance) and would outsource for cheap manpower. It was also part of the forever dominance (globalization to tie that dominance).What is happening is a rebellion, not a punishment. It's like a strike.Because neither China nor America can properly divorce.They are SIAMESE. One has the liver and the other the legs.You are reading this in the wrong way.America took from Britain (Pax Americana) the head of the 'Global power'but London never ceased being the real head (Banks and the hidden hand)Israel was created and existed to have the nukes of the final day to be pointed at Moscow. And that is WRITTEN. Samson doctrine is exactly that.They cannot give up ISrael and will do anything to keep it because the moment it's lost (especially with Moscow having hypersonics) all goes to shit.Ukraine is the same case.The objective is Russia and its resources.China and America are far from being enemies. China is making the price to help America re: Russia way higher. They are betting every chip (literally).What Trump did (he has, like you, a fixation) was pushing China against a wall and the 'globalist ties' (such as WEF) were cut de facto because the motherfucker thought he was smarter than them and started the fake trade war to boast but in reality what he wanted is the crisis China is suffering now and getting Iran for Israel. Chisrael resisted (that's another organ they share, Israel).However he was imbecile and arrogant enough to fuck Xi with Covid, to fuck with Xi attacking him (America can live without legs, but China cannot without LIVER -aka big market-)So what did that get. Everything America was doing to fuck China (the 'invisible war' in the pressers) backfired because Putin, who is significantly more intelligent than them had a process going to ensure Russia's salvation in the China/US pincer organized. Primakov's doctrine.When Trump (and Biden, who is one of the Chinese minion intermediaries, just watch him begging in comms two nights ago) pushed XI, Russia made a more reasonable offer.This is not the first time China retreats from Globalization. They did centuries ago, all of a sudden, they brought back the ships and shut themselves down.Now Xi is slowly undoing his bubble. They have 5 years ahead of crisis. Putin will help. Xi cannot longer pincer because he is in need not all the way around.Putin has made China retreat from many places in Africa without taking them for Russia (loyalty). He has organized a massive denial of resources to the looters (YOU). China would like to go to the ole' WEF times but he can't.Now we have the Nvidia situation (meant to crush China, the chips act)That's the war.America and Russia can go autarkic. China will never be able unless it takes Russia.It's a very weird situation you still don't understand well because your priors are stuck. Reality is weirder and way more KABUKI than you make it.The punishment is not coming from China.China was using the diaspora to steal secrets for their development. China is a big country with people quickly aging, the results of Ford's ONE CHILD mandate /it was fucking Ford, not the Chinese, it was the Americans who put that as a condition in the Nixon era/. That's another of your sneaky nasty maneuvers coming back to bite your arse.America is not being punished. America is being boomerangedAmerica is wanting to divorce by cutting itself the legs or making the legs by crushing the siamese body. It was Trump launching the all-war against their partner. Xi stayed many days in Mar a Lago. Xi's daughter was under Trump's care in the US.The person who is changing everything to SURVIVE is Putin.Multipolarity is intelligent but it takes courage to finally leave the hegemonic pedestal, lick the wounds, fix the country. It's very humiliating because it's humbling and you will not be able to fight an easy war ever again.That's the problem.If we make it through the next months, things will improve for all at the end.Everyone at their own home fixing their own problems and cordially trading under new, better rules.There's no other way.It's the Good, bad and the ugly duel. First to jump dies.@otiswoe It would depend on the age of your hardware. New kernels don't fully support some older hardware, so newer isn't always better. For instance, I have an 32-bit server with an older Nvidia card installed that will not work the way I want with any kernels above 4.19 due to the kernel not supporting the older Nvidia driver, as I prefer using Nvidia's driver plug-in with Compiz over the Nouveau.If you haven't installed anything yet, go ahead with Debian 12 and see if you can get all your hardware working properly. If not, go back a version level. It's always possible that, in the future, kernels might support the old hardware but, unless a lot of people want it, probably not.Report: South Carolina Voters Unable to Vote due to Internet Outage – Voters Told to Put Ballots in ‘Another Slot’ – “For Years the Media Dismissed Claim that Vote Counting Machines Were Connected to the Internet Was a Baseless Conspiracy Theory.” - from Monday's edition of http://theVeryRight.com/newsDead Horses, Scraps, Leaves: Gaza’s Hungry Get Desperate – by Barron’sPentagon Probing over 50 Cases of ‘Theft, Fraud or Corruption’ Linked to Ukraine Aid – by SputnikCoincidence?
