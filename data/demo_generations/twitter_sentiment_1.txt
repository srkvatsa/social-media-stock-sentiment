ITS THE BIGGEST 1 DAY GAIN FOR ANY COMPANY IN HISTORY 

$NVDA https://t.co/cQspvny0sf@davidshap4711 This is a somewhat poorly thought through take. In 2022 the entire market took a hit, not just Nvidia. It’s intellectually lazy to simply draw a link to the btc mining “falling in a heap” because the btc hash rate was quite robust in 2022.A new week, a new record...

Nvidia added another $247 billion to its valuation today following a "better than expected" Q4 earnings report

That's the equivalent of an entire year's GDP for a small, high-income country such as Greece, Qatar, Portugal or New Zealand https://t.co/hTzDHkFphUIt’s interesting when Nvidia stock goes up most other chip ones do as well except for Intel@NemanjaIv6 I would agree on that Nvidia didn’t push all AI but it brought up people who are in speculation I see sometimes on my timeline people talking 70 $ for RNDR which would be insane. 
Akash is like 280% behind rnrd in terms of marketcap. I believe if the AI trends stays that it will@FortuneMagazine I don't think so, I'll keep following it. Nvidia is not trading at bubble levels. Global demand for chips is robust and Nvidia’s results were above expectations. They have reached what we in mathematics call the inflection point,So technically nvidia is pretty undervalued….Top 5 Largest Companies in the world by Market Cap:

Is a $2 trillion market cap on the horizon? https://t.co/oeCCvU8f23It will clearly be a bubble because in terms of revenue, it's not comparable, but the hype will be so high that Nvidia might become the largest market capitalization by 2025.If OpenAI and Google launch autonomous agents this year and demonstrate that they offer much more value than simple LLMs, we should expect Nvidia to compete with Apple and Microsoft.@gordon_gekko_29 Zajímalo by mne porovnání Nvidia ale i celé velké 7
