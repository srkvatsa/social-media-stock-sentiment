Is The AI Bubble Bursting? Wolf Richter's WTF Charts<br />Is it gold's turn now?<br />John Rubino<br />Artificial intelligence, which a few years ago existed only in science fiction (check out William Gibson’s Neuromancer), has morphed into an epic stock bubble. Nvidia, maker of the leading AI microchips, saw its market cap surge from $200 billion in 2019 to $2 trillion in 2023. I haven’t actually checked, but that might be the fastest episode of paper wealth creation in human history.<br />So it’s possible that this sector got … ahem … a little ahead of itself. And last week it corrected brutally.<br />Wolf Richer just posted some charts showing how bad — and widespread — the damage was. Here’s the AI part of his article:<br />Nvidia [NVDA] plunged 10% today, to $762.00, the worst one-day plunge since March 2020. It’s down 21.8% from its all-time high of $974 on March 25. It became infamous here in this joint on February 24, when we honored it with a WTF Chart of the Year. At that time, Nvidia’s market cap had spiked to nearly $2 trillion, and shares to $788.<br />We compared it to our WTF-Charts-of-the-Year of Tesla, which a couple of years later made it into our pantheon of Imploded Stocks, though its business continued to boom, and its Model Y became the bestselling model in the world. It just meant that the mania had begun to seep out of the stock.<br />The minimum qualification for making it into the pantheon: the stock has to drop at least 70% from the all-time high. For NVDA to be inducted into the pantheon, the stock would have to drop to $292, and that’s not hard, that’s where it had been only 10 months ago. It was already a very high-priced stock back then. So today, we’ll honor it with a new and improved WTF chart of the year.<br />But it gets funnier. I mean, look, you can’t take this stuff seriously.<br />Super Micro Computer [SMCI] has been deeply tangled up in the AI mania by being one of the many vendors that build servers based on Nvidia’s GPUs. The stock collapsed by 23% today to $713.65 after the company skipped announcing the preliminary results that had been expected ahead of its official earnings results. At these stock prices, anything can trigger a get-the-hell-out moment. It is down by 42% from its all-time high on March 8 ($1,229).<br />Over the 12 months from up to the all-time high, the stock had gained over 1,100%. This stuff is just hilarious. Kids having a bunch of fun or whatever. It has now given up 40% of that gain. This stuff shows just how silly the markets had gotten.<br />Arm Holdings [ARM] plunged 16.9% today to $87.19. Over the past three trading days, it has plunged by 28.7%. The chip designer IPOed in September 2023. At the time, SoftBank had owned 90% of it, and it still holds a huge portion of it. In February, ARM had doubled in a matter of days:<br />Read the rest here.<br />Maybe It’s Gold’s Turn Now<br />AI isn’t going away. As Richter notes, Tesla went through a similar correction but continues to dominate the EV market. This story is about the stock market, not the technology.<br />And, okay, part of my motivation for posting this is schadenfreude. We commodities investors watched from the sidelines as insane amounts of easy money were made almost accidentally by people who didn’t see it coming (because no one foresaw the magnitude of this bubble).<br />In a just universe, it would be gold’s turn to suddenly enrich its owners. Let’s see how that goes. <br /><a href="https://rubino.substack.com/p/is-the-ai-bubble-bursting-wolf-richters?publication_id=1166121&amp;post_id=143786210&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=pf5v4&amp;triedRedirect=true" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://</span>rubino.substack.com/p/is-the-ai-bubble-bursti<span class="invisible">ng-wolf-richters?publication_id=1166121&amp;post_id=143786210&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=pf5v4&amp;triedRedirect=true</span><span class="ellipsis"></span></a>

Right now as I type this, companies like Nvidia, Intel have these HUGE AI farms where rows &amp; rows of computer GPU's in a building are training AI to get better &amp; better &amp; better.<br /><br />Look how fast it improved. <br /><br />Obviously with AI, it can "calculate" what SHOULD happen vs what is happening hence why GPU manufacturers who have kinda hit Moores Law Limit are all over it. "Frame generation" magically made old 5-10 year GPU's increase FPS in modern games by 3x<br /><br />With AI, it can artificially boost "FPS" an smooth things out to the point it can boost performance by 50X<br /><br />Now................imagine AI in about 5, 10, 20, 50 years..............AI would be so smart, you couldn't comprehend it but it would be mindlessly obedient to it's master and would have ZERO morals, or "ew factor" like say orchestrating a genocide or something.<br /><br />AI could craft endless perfect EVIL schemes. From rigging stock markets, an massive political propaganda campaigns to manipulate social media, psychological warfare far beyond what you could possibly comprehend.

I've have so many problems the last years. systemctl, lightdm, could never get nvidia to work with wayland, tried to get lvm/qemu to do something useful for over a year. Weeks looking for answers on the internet. Eventually, I did a fresh install. Some things got better, other got worse. Still no nvidia with wayland. A weird lag appeared when I type in gnome-terminal. I'ts just too much.<br />Windows appeared in weird places and if I tried to move them, the UI hangs for 5-10 seconds.<br />Now, during my last attempt to get amdgpu driver to work, I lost the ability to run a graphical desktop completely. apt/dpkg have not been friendly.<br />Luckily, I decided to dump LVM and go for a double-boot so now it's 100% Windows 11. It sucks in so many ways but it is predictable. No surprises except the occasional malware to deal with.<br /><br /> don't think it's my hardware (ProArt X670E-CREATOR, Ryzen 7, 8700G, 96G RAM.)I have developed apps that only work on linux so not being able to use Linux is a major setback. Debugging GTK4-apps under MSYS2/mingw64 is a complete nightmare but at least I get something done. I've spent a week last two month trying to fix stuff under linux but nothing works. The GTK4 gang completely broke me when they switched to the new renderer, so there's that. At least under windows, the GTK4 stuff is in msys2/mingw so that's a bit of a sandbox that lets me go on.

There's officially used Instinct data center GPUs on the market for $600 with 32 GB of VRAM.<br /><br />AMD had better quit cheaping out on their consumer cards VRAM by just mirroring what Nvidia does. They don't have the data center cushion Team Green does. <br /><br />I'm still skipping the 9000 series, but hopefully shit will make sense again by 2026.

When will they develop emergency food that tastes good like say, sushi?  Wouldn't you love to have a 25 year supply of various types of sushi and edamami that you can simply eat as needed?<br /><br />We can do that with good Bordeaux wine-a key component of any survival plan.   I've got that already along with some nice Zinfindel and Cab.   Why not sushi?   Don't we have AI to figure it out?  Or, is that just a bunch of hype to sell Nvidia stock?<br /><br />That's when I become a prepper. For now I'll have to stick to gold, guns, and ammo.  And Bordeaux of course.  And Guiness.

From Forbes: (Something A Leftist Would Never Understand)<br /><br />“I wish you ample doses of pain and suffering.”<br /><br />That is the unconventional message Nvidia CEO and founder Jensen Huang had for students at Stanford University, his alma mater, where he spoke last month at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.<br /><br />According to Huang, elite educational pedigrees alone are not necessarily the best predictor of success.<br /><br />“Greatness is not intelligence. Greatness comes from character. And character isn’t formed out of smart people, it’s formed out of people who suffered,” said the Stanford alum.

Taiwan - Earthquakes &amp; semiconductors ...<br />.<br /><br />Semiconductors power everything we do, from driving our cars to talking on our smartphones - even our military defenses, weapons systems, and airlines. - Everything uses chips. - A production halt would be bad for the global economy.<br /><br />Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) manufactures 80% of the advanced chips that power smartphones, electric vehicles, and cutting-edge AI tech like ChatGPT. - It is one of the world’s most influential companies. - However, it is located in Taiwan, where a recent earthquake reminded investors of the fragility of this island’s supply chain.<br /><br />Following a 7.4-magnitude earthquake last Wednesday, TSM said impacted facilities would resume production the next day. - However, certain production lines could take months for automated production to resume.<br /><br />Some of the high-end chips need 24/7 seamless operations in a vacuum state. So, even an hours-long shutdown of certain chip production could take weeks to recover. - Barclays analysts noted that “operation halts could mean some high-end chips in production may get spoiled.” - The bank estimates TSM could lose $60 million this quarter from the disruption.<br /><br />However, it’s not just TSM that suffers. - Hundreds of companies relying on TSM’s chips — including tech giants like Apple, Nvidia, Broadcom, and more – also risk production problems that could tank earnings, just like in 2021 when chip shortages cost automotive companies up to $200 billion.<br /><br />Taiwan has always been prone to earthquakes because it’s near the convergence of two tectonic plates

Five-Stock Portfolio #2: Energy<br />AI is an energy market game-changer<br />John Rubino<br />Artificial intelligence is here, and it’s hungry. Current projections for how much power AI server farms will consume are, well, shocking. From a recent Scientific American article:<br />    Every online AI interaction relies on a scaffolding of information stored in remote servers—and those machines, stacked together in data centers worldwide, require a lot of energy. Around the globe, data centers currently account for about 1 to 1.5 percent of global electricity use, according to the International Energy Agency. And the world’s still-exploding boom in artificial intelligence could drive that number up a lot—and fast.<br />    A peer-reviewed analysis published this week in Joule is one of the first to quantify the demand that is quickly materializing. A continuation of the current trends in AI capacity and adoption are set to lead to NVIDIA shipping 1.5 million AI server units per year by 2027. These 1.5 million servers, running at full capacity, would consume at least 85.4 terawatt-hours of electricity annually—more than what many small countries use in a year, according to the new assessment.<br />Energy Stocks Are A Must-Own<br />Two things are obvious from the above: First, we’re going to need way more power than we’re currently producing.

Big mouth worthless political propaganda. Worthless scams.<br /><br />What is valuable? An example. Commerce Secretary Raimondo's work in sanctioning microchips to Commies Fake China. But, the overall strategy is plain stupidity. Sanction Nvidia's A100 and 800 (top end) and it produces H100 &amp; 800 for the evil rats. <br /><br />Right, just sanction the critical top end ones, be it microchips or banning their foreign students from studying sensitive high tech in USA's unis.

Costs next to nothing. Whatever detour the rats use to acquire the microchips once they use them in ratland you can remotely shut down the microchips. This should help. It makes life more difficult for them as they have to use them out of ratland. <br /><br />COMPLETE decoupling, from socks to microchips to foreign students to immigration, if you know what commies fake china is about, its intentions, mindsets....etc. Kick commie Biden &amp; his actors bunch out too, that goes without saying. <br /><br />🔔 𝑵𝒗𝒊𝒅𝒊𝒂 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝑨𝑰 𝒄𝒉𝒊𝒑 𝒔𝒕𝒐𝒄𝒌 𝒓𝒆𝒎𝒂𝒊𝒏 𝑻𝒐𝒑 𝑷𝒊𝒄𝒌𝒔 𝒂𝒕 𝑩𝒐𝒇𝑨<br /><br /><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/nvidia-and-this-ai-chip-stock-remain-top-picks-at-bofa/ar-BB1kSJgO" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span>msn.com/en-us/money/markets/nvidia-and-this-a<span class="invisible">i-chip-stock-remain-top-picks-at-bofa/ar-BB1kSJgO</span><span class="ellipsis"></span></a><br /><br /><a href="https://gab.com/KariLake" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@KariLake</a>  <a href="https://gab.com/MiltonWolfMD" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@MiltonWolfMD</a> <a href="https://gab.com/DrSimoneGold" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@DrSimoneGold</a> <a href="https://gab.com/realdonaldtrump" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@realdonaldtrump</a> <a href="https://gab.com/RepMattGaetz" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@RepMattGaetz</a> <a href="https://gab.com/RepAndyBiggs" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@RepAndyBiggs</a>

Trump Media doesn't add up<br /><br />Measuring value<br />Let’s assume, for a second, that Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp. is a normal company whose stock should be judged by the merits of any other normal stock. With that in mind, let’s examine some of the financial fundamentals.<br /><br />In case you need to get up to speed, TMTG (as I’ll call it) is the parent company of Truth Social, the social network founded in 2021 by Donald Trump. In October 2021, it agreed to merge into Digital World Acquisition Corp., a blank-check company. <br /><br />Blank-check companies — or SPACs, as they are also known — enjoyed a brief moment back in 2021 as a way for companies to go public without much scrutiny of their finances. They simply merged into publicly traded firms with no operations that were sitting on a big pile of cash that investors had more or less blindly trusted the board to invest wisely. <br /><br />And reader, it often didn’t end well. By the end of 2023, at least 21 companies that went public through SPAC mergers have gone bankrupt. In total, SPACs lost investors — often retail stock buyers — some $46 billion from the peak of their valuations.<br /><br />On Tuesday, TMTG became a public company after its merger was finally approved last week. And when the shares started trading in New York with the ticker DJT, they jumped 42% to $70.90. That valued the company at $9.6 billion. By the close of regular trading, the shares had come back down to $57.99, which added about $650 million to Trump’s net worth because of his ownership stake, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.<br /><br />Which brings us to the fundamentals. Based on that opening share price, TMTG is likely valued at more than 2,000 times annual revenue — taking the reported $3.4 million in nine-month sales and estimating for the year. Now, tech companies are often afforded generous valuations based on the assumption of rapid growth and the promise of future riches – or at least they were before interest rates increased.<br /><br />But let’s put that multiple of sales in some context: Nvidia Corp., the hit stock of the artificial intelligence revolution, is valued at just 38 times sales. When the preeminent social media platform of the past two decades, Facebook Inc. (now Meta Platforms Inc.) went public in 2012, it was valued at 12.5 times revenue. The only similar point of comparison that springs to mind is Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp, which at the time had little revenue to speak of, for $19 billion in 2014.<br /><br />WhatsApp did, of course, have a lot of users, though. About 450 million, at the time. TMTG doesn’t actually report the number of active users, though it said in a January regulatory filing that it has had “9.0 million signups for Truth Social via iOS, Android and the web.” Generously, each of those users is therefore afforded $1,067 in value. Meta is currently valued at $422 per monthly active Facebook user. It’s highly likely, however, that only a fraction of the signups to Truth Social use the app anything like monthly.<br /><br />And we haven’t even mentioned Trump Media’s reported $49 million loss in the nine months ending in September. <br /><br />All of which might explain why Trump Media is now the most expensive US stock to bet against, as Bloomberg News reported. There’s not much stock available (the number of shares being traded is pretty low), and lots of people think it’s overvalued. In other words, it’s a meme stock. —Alex Webb
I have an older computer with an Intel I7 2.66 Ghz (4 core), Nvidia GeForce GTX 970, running Windows 10 and was curious what older version of Blender I should to dabble into 3d printing.

<a href="https://gab.com/doppler00" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@doppler00</a> That's what I do, I use the intel integrated graphics for hdmi audio.  Zero problems... except for intel bug that causes it to forget which channel is which (rare but sends the right channel to the rear? lol reboot to fix that one) 🤷<br /><br />If you have a desktop, setting nvidia to max performance isn't really an issue.  Don't really want to do that with a laptop though.<br /><br />I wonder if AMD has any issues. 😆 <br /><br />But like I said, the nvidia sound issues don't exist when the GPU is active, only when idle.  So it is fine when gaming.

China's government will no longer buy Intel or AMD chips, or Microsoft products, for its PCs <br /><br />China's government has reportedly started enforcing a new law that it passed in December this week. The law bans the government from purchasing PCs with Intel and AMD ﻿chips inside, along with software products from Microsoft, including its Windows operating system.<br /><br />According to The Financial Times (via PC World), the new rules on purchasing products for China's government PCs were set in place in December by the country's Information Technology Security Evaluation Center. They include all governments and agencies above what is considered to be the country's township level.<br /><br />China previously ordered its government offices and agencies to no longer use Microsoft's Windows OS in 2022, in favor of a homegrown Linux-based OS. As a result, these new guidelines are not expected to affect Microsoft. However, the ban on Intel and AMD chips could result in a noticeable hit in the revenue numbers for both companies.<br /><br />On the other hand, the ban on these products on China's government PCs does not include their use in private businesses or by regular consumers in that country.<br /><br />China previously banned the use of Apple's iPhone products in its government buildings. It has also banned the use of products from Micron Technology for its infrastructure projects, citing security concerns.<br /><br />These new moves come sometime after the United States government banned China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) from exporting fabrication equipment to make certain chips in that country.<br /><br />Late in 2023, the US government banned the export of some of Nvidia's AI GPUs to China. Nvidia has instead developed AI chips, the H20, that were specifically made to conform to the restrictions of the US government's export rules. The company started taking preorders for the H20 chips in early 2024, and are expected to begin large scale shipments of those China-specific AI GPUs sometime in the second quarter of 2024.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/chinas-government-will-no-longer-buy-intel-or-amd-chips-or-microsoft-products-for-its-pcs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span>neowin.net/news/chinas-government-will-no-lon<span class="invisible">ger-buy-intel-or-amd-chips-or-microsoft-products-for-its-pcs/</span><span class="ellipsis"></span></a>

<a href="https://gab.com/doppler00" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@doppler00</a> If you are using nvidia audio over hdmi, beware that their audio driver has a bug that causes buffer underruns (clicks/pops).  It has been an issue for many years and I doubt they will ever fix it.<br /><br />It won't be an issue playing games because the GPU will be active, but it can show up watching videos or listening to music.<br /><br />The workaround is to set "Power management mode" to "Prefer maximum performance".

<a href="https://gab.com/BubberCats" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@BubberCats</a> so, for your use case, I would say use a different distro. I would go with PopOS (its the most gamer friendly out of the box). You CAN just encrypt the home folder, but there is no real benefit to that, do the whole drive. It is just good security practice.<br /><br />As for games, use Steam for Linux. They have come a LONG way, and can usually emulate most "windows only" games on Linux. Of course all of the valve games have Linux native versions (CS, portal, half-life etc)<br /><br />If you have a discrete GPU (like nvidia or AMD) PopOS gives you out of the box support without extra hoops. It is an Ubuntu derivative, just bundled with a better DWM and more useable things

No fight, after many years of not paying attention, watching everything I grew up with systematiclly destroyed and my ancestory reviled; my first thought now is how are they going to use this for evil and power control.  Totally agree there.<br /><br />In my option, the LLM is silicon valley's cold fusion. Lot's of money will be burned on this looking for it to surplant large swaths of white collar jobs. The problem is it's not creative all. It's only regurgitates what it's ingested. Any business that uses this tool for running critical business functions will stagnant, if they can keep it from being taken over via clever hacks.<br /><br />Right now the only people making money on this tool is Nvidia and other GPU manufacturers. The rest is a bonfire of stacks of money, a la Joker.<br /><br />Plus like crypto this all hinges on a solid electrical supply and we are doing a good job of shooting the economy in the chest with the forced transition to green energy.<br /><br />One positive case is LLM teachers by subject for home schooling. Best case is another silicon valley collapse wiping out 80% of the crap, including LLM "investments". There are enough open source tools to survive a collapse as long as we have functioning electricity. <br /><br />Are people trying to use this tool to summon demons? Yes, and it won'tbe the last tool they try that with. Will they succeed, doubt it. And they'll poison their own souls along the way.<br /><br />Didn't mean to turn this into an effort poast, there's a lot to unpack here and need some whiskey and a fire pit to have a quality conversation.

The Swiss National Center for Scientific Computing is about to inaugurate an exceptional supercomputer, powered by Nvidia's Grace Hopper cards. These cards are delivered in small quantities by truck, under the close supervision of insurers. And for good reason: impossible to find stock, prices are soaring, 30 to 40,000 francs per unit. On paper, they promise to revolutionize the field by being able to train a model like GPT-3 in just two days."<br /><br />Hot, and hungry...<br />"The processors will be cooled directly by Lake Lugano. The water is pumped to the bottom of the lake at 6 degrees. And that's an entire floor of piping that's needed to keep the computer from melting. By calculating, the temperature of the processors rises up to 90 degrees. Imagine 10,000 processors gathered in the same place !"<br />-- our lakes have problems to cool down, mix oxygen, but nevermind...<br /><br />"But the most impressive thing about these supercomputers is the super consumption of electricity. The center is equipped with 17 transformers. At full capacity, it is the equivalent of a city of 25,000 inhabitants. “Today, consumption corresponds more to a village of 4000-5000 inhabitants,” explains Michele De Lorenzi, deputy director of the center. Note that all electricity comes from hydroelectric plants in the region."<br />-- adding the consumption of a whole new city while crying about energy shortages, that for sure is "impressive"...

<a href="https://gab.com/Foxx6974" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@Foxx6974</a> It's not for gaming. It's a workstation card. Workstation cards don't err as much. You have a glitch on a gaming card it may have an artifact in a game on your screen. Workstation cards are designed for CAD and things. If you have an err there it can be a major problem. On the gaming front, I think it's best to get Radeon if you're buying new. If you're getting used, Nvidia can still be a good buy because of their fast processors. Plus, they have total manipulation of the gaming software. It's like this DLSS stuff. I have to turn it off. It looks like crap on the screen, and I start to get a headache. Just turn the settings down a notch and run it 4K native.

<a href="https://gab.com/Foxx6974" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@Foxx6974</a> It's interesting how they use HBM memory on them. Radeon started using it on their video cards 10 years ago. Nvidia also tends to put too little RAM on their cards also. Just enough so it will phase out properly and still be competitive.

Intel has encountered significant setbacks in launching new chips and in its ambitious turnaround plan. <br /><br />However, there is good news: The White House announced Wednesday morning that the US Department of Commerce has reached a "preliminary agreement" with Intel to provide upwards of $8.5 billion in grants and as much as $11 billion in loans under the CHIPS and Science Act to expand semiconductor factories in the US. <br /><br />The Biden administration's announcement is not a surprise, mainly because Intel has struggled for several years in its turnaround plan. The funding will significantly expand the construction of Intel chip factories in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico, and Oregon.

"I Wish Upon You Ample Doses Of Pain And Suffering"<br />“When Heaven is about to confer a great office on a man, it first exercises his mind with suffering, and his sinews and bones with toil,” whispered Xi to himself, contemplating the ancient wisdom of Mencius, born 100yrs after Confucius and considered Confucianism’s 2nd sage.<br />“It exposes his body to hunger, and subjects him to extreme poverty; it confounds his undertakings,” continued Xi, alone on a long walk. “By all these methods it stimulates his mind, hardens his nature, and supplies his incompetencies.”<br />Xi’s intelligence services had sent him TikTok videos of Jensen Huang, the founder/CEO of Nvidia, who spoke this week at Stanford University, in the heart of Silicon Valley. Jensen was born in Taiwan in 1963, his ancestors having escaped from the Communists all those years ago. His family made their way to Kentucky, where Jensen was mercilessly bullied by racists and worked at Denny’s where he washed dishes and cleaned toilets as he made his way through school.<br />And now this remarkable man who in a parallel universe would have grown up as a Chinese national, is worth <a href="/tags/80bln" class="" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$80bln</a> and built the firm which is leading the West into an unknowable future of artificial intelligence.<br />“Greatness comes from character and character isn’t formed out of smart people – it’s formed out of people who suffered,” said Jensen Huang to the captivated Stanford students.<br />I was fortunate that I grew up with my parents providing a condition for us to be successful on the one hand, but there were plenty of opportunities for setbacks and suffering,” continued Huang, his wisdom racing across social media. Xi sighed, increasingly confused, marveling at Jensen's wildly popular reception, while his directive to Chinese youth to “eat bitterness” had left them lying flat.<br />“I don’t know how to do it for all of you Stanford students, but I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering,” said Huang, as Xi felt a growing sickness rise from within.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/i-wish-upon-you-ample-doses-pain-and-suffering" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span>zerohedge.com/markets/i-wish-upon-you-ample-d<span class="invisible">oses-pain-and-suffering</span><span class="ellipsis"></span></a>

Several significant upgrades to its Isaac robotics platform were also announced, including generative AI foundation models and tools for AI workflow.<br /><br />The new project is called GR00T, which stands for Generalist Robot 00 Technology. It’s intended to serve as a platform to enable robots to “understand natural language and emulate movements by observing human actions – quickly learning coordination, dexterity and other skills in order to navigate, adapt and interact with the real world,” the US-based company said.<br /><br />In a keynote presentation, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang demonstrated several real-life robots already using the GR00T platform to complete a variety of tasks, and showed that the robots could also develop their skills through a digital twin in the newly announced Isaac Lab virtual reality simulation.

No surprise that Biden's pick would be so hostile to natural rights — but what the others said is equally disturbing.  Here's the notable exchanges in a case that a lower court judge ruled "the most massive attack against free speech in United States' history".  That was BEFORE Brown-Jackson got involved<br />• Is coercion of corporations by government to censor, government censorship?<br />• Is a massive FBI presence in social media companies, telling them who to censor, censorship?

The left made it about violence, but Trump's economic point was misdirected.  Chinese tariffs don't address the fundamental problem of the green agenda.  It's NOT about CHINA.

Battle of the low-profile GPUs: Nvidia Quadro T600 4GB vs AMD RX 6400 4GB. Brought to you by TechDweeb. <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42Pu8IMeCEA" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span>youtube.com/watch?v=42Pu8IMeCEA<span class="invisible"></span></a>
Nvidia says the new B200 GPU offers up to 20 petaflops of FP4 horsepower from its 208 billion transistors. Also, it says, a GB200 that combines two of those GPUs with a single Grace CPU can offer 30 times the performance for LLM inference workloads while also potentially being substantially more efficient. It “reduces cost and energy consumption by up to 25x” over an H100, says Nvidia.<br />A second key difference only comes when you link up huge numbers of these GPUs: a next-gen NVLink switch that lets 576 GPUs talk to each other, with 1.8 terabytes per second of bidirectional bandwidth.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24105157/nvidia-blackwell-gpu-b200-ai" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span>theverge.com/2024/3/18/24105157/nvidia-blackw<span class="invisible">ell-gpu-b200-ai</span><span class="ellipsis"></span></a>
Bad name. Too much like Blackrock...<br /><br />Why Nvidia’s New Blackwell Chip Is Key to the Next Stage of AI<br /><br />The B200 is Nvidia’s new flagship AI product. It’s at the heart of an expansive ecosystem of products, which includes proprietary interconnect technology that allows Nvidia to sell its chips in massive clusters that function as a unified processor. The Santa Clara, California-based company will sell the B200 in a variety of options, including as part of the GB200 superchip, which combines two Blackwell GPUs, or graphics processing units, with one Grace CPU, or a general-purpose central processing unit.<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-19/nvidia-s-nvda-blackwell-b200-chip-why-it-s-so-powerful-what-it-means-for-ai" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span>bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-19/nvidia<span class="invisible">-s-nvda-blackwell-b200-chip-why-it-s-so-powerful-what-it-means-for-ai</span><span class="ellipsis"></span></a>

Nasdaq resolves two hour-long technical glitch impacting connectivity<br /><br />March 18 (Reuters) - Nasdaq (NDAQ.O), opens new tab, which hosts some of the biggest U.S. tech giants on its exchange, said on Monday it has a resolved an issue related to connectivity and stock orders after more than two hours and said all systems were operating normally.<br />The company did not give details about the severity of the issue, its second technical glitch in months, but said it was related to the matching engine - software systems that match buy and sell orders on an exchange. The incident started around 4.55 a.m. ET, according to the exchange's website.<br /><br />Thousands of stocks are listed on the Nasdaq, including those of iPhone maker Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab, electric vehicle-maker Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab and artificial intelligence semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab.<br />Technical glitches on exchanges can roil markets, hit traders' confidence and attract scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission.<br />A glitch at the New York Stock Exchange last year prevented the opening auctions for a slew of stocks, prompting widespread trading halts, confusion over whether orders were being filled at correct prices and trades in more than 250 securities being busted.<br /><br />However, outages at major exchanges have been largely contained in recent years.<br />"The Nasdaq stock market has resolved its earlier matching engine issues and all systems are operating normally," the company said on its website. It did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.<br />The exchange operator had reported similar issues in December, when stock orders were impacted and over 50 clients at the exchange were affected.<br /><br />The glitch on Monday impacted orders sent using the "RASH FIX" order handling system. FIX, or Financial Information Exchange, is a message protocol that defines an electronic message exchange for communicating securities transactions between two parties.<br />The issue also led to self-help declarations against Nasdaq from Cboe (CBOE.Z), opens new tab and New York Stock Exchange Arca Equities, which specializes in listings of exchange-traded products.<br /><br />A "self-help" is a notification issued by a trading exchange when another exchange is dealing with internal problems processing trades and orders are routed through alternate venues.<br /><br /><a href="https://archive.ph/Sl9YZ" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://</span>archive.ph/Sl9YZ<span class="invisible"></span></a>

We are building the infrastructure of human freedom… BrighteonAI is the next launch that will put life-altering LLM technology into your hands for free<br />Wait and see how quickly the government tries to ban it...<br />Mike Adams<br />Here at Natural News and Brighteon, we are building the infrastructure of human freedom.<br />Rather than building systems designed to enslave you, control you or maximize corporate profits by monetizing everything about you, we are building systems that empower you, inform you, inspire you and expand your horizons while enhancing your health.<br />We started by launching NewsTargetcom in 2003 (over twenty years ago!). A few years later, it morphed into NaturalNewscom which reached hundreds of millions of readers with truth-based talk about vaccines, nutrition, health freedom, natural medicine and the dangers of pesticides, herbicides and prescription pharmaceuticals.<br />After I was maliciously de-platformed by YouTube, we built Brighteoncom, which has become a widely recognized platform of free speech videos, where anyone can join and post free speech content at no charge.<br />A few years later, we launched BrighteonSocial, which offers a free speech social media platform without the censorship of Twitter / X and Facebook. Then we launched BrighteonTV, a video broadcast platform, and BrighteonRadiocom for audio broadcast content.<br />More recently, we launched Brighteon University at BrightUcom, which offers free educational content via video streaming, and it has already reached many millions of people with knowledge-based content.<br />All of this is supported by our customers who shop at HealthRangerStorecom, loved by hundreds of thousands of customers who trust our lab-tested, certified organic, non-GMO foods, superfoods, nutritional supplements and personal care products, most of which we manufacture ourselves right in the heart of Texas.<br />This year, we are launching two new projects that will profoundly benefit humanity. One of them is still a secret and we can't share details yet, but the other is BrighteonAI.<br />Introducing BrighteonAI, a non-woke, reality-based Large Language Model (LLM) that's free to download and use on your own local computer<br />Visit BrighteonAI now to register your email address to be alerted when we launch.<br />BrighteonAI is the distribution site for our non-profit Consumer Wellness Center Data Science division which is building and releasing free, open source LLMs that are trained on reality-based knowledge for the purpose of empowering humanity.<br />We've all seen Google's "woke" AI produce historically inaccurate images, where white people are replaced with People of Color (POC) -- a scrubbing of history that's consistent with Google's unstated mission of deliberately misinforming the world and disconnecting humanity from knowledge. And OpenAI has just added a new board member who used to work with Pfizer and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, underscoring the globalist, anti-human agenda behind OpenAI (creators of ChatGPT). Across the board, from Microsoft, Meta, Google, OpenAI and Amazon, the large corporate AI systems are being trained to lie about race, gender, climate, elections, vaccines, economics, history, science, pharmaceuticals and a thousand other topics that matter to our shared future.<br />The answer to their lies and programmed misinformation is found in the open source LLM community where "base models" have been released that can be trained with new content and given new knowledge by any organization that has sufficient resources to build out a sufficiently large data pipeline and LLM training center (with lots of NVIDIA GPUs, it turns out).<br />This is what we have done. We launched our <a href="http://Brighteon.AI" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">http://</span>Brighteon.AI<span class="invisible"></span></a> project in the last quarter of 2023, and throughout 2024, we will be releasing numerous LLMs that are available for the public to freely download and use on their local Windows, Mac or Linux systems, completely free of charge and without sacrificing your privacy. These models run locally on your own hardware, and they can replace Google and other search engines for the vast majority of questions you might ask. Because they run locally (around 8 GB - 16 GB of RAM is typically required for your local computer), they even work if the internet goes offline. You do not need an internet connection to run these models, in other words.<br />continued<br /><a href="https://healthranger.substack.com/p/we-are-building-the-infrastructure?publication_id=1225906&amp;post_id=142701725&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=pf5v4&amp;triedRedirect=true" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://</span>healthranger.substack.com/p/we-are-building-t<span class="invisible">he-infrastructure?publication_id=1225906&amp;post_id=142701725&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=pf5v4&amp;triedRedirect=true</span><span class="ellipsis"></span></a>

<a href="https://gab.com/medicinalflowers" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@medicinalflowers</a>  At the most basic level what it means is that people/organizations will need more compute. This also means a huge microchip boom is happening right now and new players and paradigms are starting to emerge to solve the problem of more compute. <br /><br />There are two issues that society has to solve, chip efficiency and chip production.  We are in the midst of a chip boom with only couple players in the market and they can only produce so much so fast. They also have many layers of proprietary red tape they have to deal with, i.e. licensing. However we have several types of new chips coming out now that solve one or both of the problems. Photonic, thermal, and various analog memristor chips are starting to hit the market.<br /><br />Rain Neuromorphic claims their chip is 10,000% more power efficient  but since it is analog there has to be a software system to quantize the analog signal to a digital signal so that it can interface with traditional architectures. They have the power aspect solved and potentially the manufacturing aspect. The company is using the RISC-V open architecture so they do not have to deal with any licensing. They also claim it is using nano-wires as the neurons on the chip. They didn't say anything about how easy it is to build but they did say that the chips do not need to be identical like traditional chips, variation or noise is tolerable. This had me thinking this could very easily simplify manufacturing and drastically increase manufacturing outputs. This is just one company out of dozens that are traveling down the same problem domain.<br /><br />If you are interested in where hardware is going here is a list of the key players that I have been following.<br /><br />Neuromorphic Computing<br />*BrainChip Holdings: Develops neuromorphic computing chips that mimic brain processing.<br />*Rain Neuromorphic: Focused on creating hardware for neuromorphic computing.<br />*Intel Labs: Has neuromorphic computing projects, including Loihi, a neuromorphic research chip.<br />*Hewlett Packard Enterprise: Working on neuromorphic systems and memristor technology.<br /><br />Quantum Computing<br />*IBM Quantum: Developing quantum computers and offering cloud-based quantum computing services.<br />*Rigetti Computing: Specializes in quantum computing hardware and software.<br />*D-Wave Systems: Focuses on quantum annealing technology for optimization and sampling problems.<br />*Quantum Brilliance: Developing diamond-based quantum computers operable at room temperature.<br /><br />Photonic Computing<br />*Lightmatter: Develops processors that use light for processing AI workloads.<br />*Optalysys: Specializes in optical computing technology for machine learning and simulation.<br />*Luminous: Working on photonic computers for AI applications.<br /><br />Analog Computing<br />*Mythic AI: Produces analog computation-based AI chips for edge devices.<br />*Aspinity: Develops analog event-driven computing solutions for sensor data processing.<br /><br />Digital ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)<br />*NVIDIA: Leader in GPUs for AI and deep learning.<br />*AMD: Offers GPUs and CPUs that are widely used in AI computing.<br />*Google: Developed the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for accelerating machine learning workloads.<br /><br />FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) and Custom Silicon<br />*Xilinx (now part of AMD): Offers FPGAs that are used for flexible hardware acceleration of AI workloads.<br />*Intel: Provides FPGAs and has acquired Altera, a leading FPGA manufacturer.<br />*Graphcore: Produces the Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) for AI and machine learning computations.

<a href="https://gab.com/Mkulu" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@Mkulu</a> Yes,  I was hoping there was something that would work on Windows, which is what I have on my higher spec PC with Nvidia GPU.  Thanks though.
<a href="https://gab.com/TrutherNurse" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@TrutherNurse</a>  As I understand it, firmware is the current target point.  I've heard that nVidia created faux "open source" drivers for their graphics cards by merely offloading the proprietary sections into the cards' firmware.  We have to keep in mind we're dealing with corporations, the profit motives of which conflict with our desire for freedom.  And even if you use FOSS and open hardware, a sneaky bit of firmware can give away all your privacy without you even knowing.
@Retro_Fan I'm no Nvidia fan, I'm still running on an old 6900XT, but the 4090 is a monster, credit where credit is due. The potential of the 5090 with GDDR7, a 512 bit bus, and potentially more VRAM would be impressive any way you slice it.<br />I'm not going to pay the premium though. I could, but I can't justify it.<br />On the AMD side, they are doing the same shit with FSR3 and frame generation.
It's that time again for PC Gamers with the rumor mill on NextGen GPU's heating up. At least on the Nvidia side. The RTX 5090 looks like it could be a BEAST with significant performance over the <br /> RTX 4090.<br />I hope AMD has SOMETHING up their sleeve.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDBEgkkZh-Q" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span>youtube.com/watch?v=CDBEgkkZh-Q<span class="invisible"></span></a>

India ofcourse, has zero work culture --- India likes to blame disorganization and callous work culture, and everything bad to overpopulation, but we all know that's a lame excuse, because China has shown its possible to be organized and good work culture inspite of overpopulation (India and China almost same population or population density now).

<p>❗❗❗❗❗❗ I N S A N E ❗❗❗❗❗❗</p><p><strong>This is proof that the silver price is far too low!</strong> </p><p><strong>MANIPULATION WITHOUT END !</strong></p><p><strong>--------------------------------------------------</strong></p><p><strong>Bitcoin value overtakes the value of all silver worldwide with a new all-time high</strong></p><p>13:48- Finance100</p><p>Bitcoin is rushing from record to record. With the rapid rise in prices, it is now leaving traditional investment products behind. Now silver has been hit.</p><p>The Bitcoin price is currently experiencing unprecedented highs. The total value of the digital currency Bitcoin exceeded the value of all silver holdings worldwide on Monday. According to calculations by the specialist portal “Infinite Market Cap”, all Bitcoins were worth more than 1.41 trillion dollars (1.3 trillion euros) for the first time. The oldest cryptocurrency thus left behind the total value of silver ($ 1.38 trillion).</p><p>The calculation is based on estimates that say around 1.74 million tons of silver have been mined worldwide so far. On Monday afternoon, Bitcoin was trading on stock exchanges for around $ 71,700.</p><p>Launch of the Bitcoin fund attracts new investors<br />For the rapid rise in the price ofBitcoin has recently been particularly concerned with large investors such as Grayscale, BlackRock and Fidelity, who have launched Bitcoin funds in the USA. These Bitcoin ETFs were approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in January. They allow investors to invest in Bitcoin without having to directly purchase or hold the digital currency itself.</p><p>Bitcoin’s rally began last fall. Since the beginning of the year alone, digital money has increased by around 62 percent against the dollar. Gold tops the list of the most valuable investment products in “Infinite Market Cap”. Here the total holdings worldwide are ten times the value of Bitcoin (14.7 trillion dollars).</p><p>Listed companies then follow in the ranking: Microsoft is in second place with a market value of $ 3.02 trillion, followed by Apple ($ 2.64 trillion) and the AI ​​chip manufacturer Nvidia (2.19 trillion).</p><p>Bitcoin remains highly speculative - and can also lose value again</p><p>With the new Bitcoin all-time high, there is no guarantee that the Bitcoin price will continue to rise in the future. After the previous high of around 69,000 dollars on November 10, 2021, the price fell to below 17,000 dollars within a year, also because the scandal surrounding the criminal activities surrounding the crypto exchange FTX shook the confidence of investors.</p><p>The strong Bitcoin price development is also likely to factor in an event that is expected for April 20th: the next so-called halving. The reward that Bitcoin miners receive for verifying crypto transactions is halved. Ultimately, the process leads to a slower growing supply of Bitcoin, which in the past has usually resulted in rising prices.</p><p><a href="https://www-finanzen100-de.translate.goog/finanznachrichten/boerse/bitcoin-wert-ueberholt-mit-neuem-allzeithoch-den-wert-des-gesamten-silbers-weltweit_H484823836_259749747/?_x_tr_sl=de&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=de" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span aria-hidden="true" class="invisible">https://</span>www-finanzen100-de.translate.goog/finanznachr<span aria-hidden="true" class="invisible">ichten/boerse/bitcoin-wert-ueberholt-mit-neuem-allzeithoch-den-wert-des-gesamten-silbers-weltweit_H484823836_259749747/?_x_tr_sl=de&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=de</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="ellipsis"></span></a></p>

"With the recent NVIDIA 550.54.14 Linux driver release the R550 series is now out as stable. One of the prominent changes with the NVIDIA R550 Linux driver is bringing the GeForce and workstation GPU support up to "CERTIFIED" quality when using NVIDIA's open kernel modules that are distributed as part of their driver package. Previously the open-source (out-of-tree) kernel modules were just certified for their data center GPUs while now they are basically acknowledging that they are in good shape too for GeForce and workstation products.

I have a few UPS units here at the house.  One on my desktop, one on my server, one for the "entertainment" system (flat screen tv, Blu-ray players, a/v receiver, Nvidia shield), and one on the computer in the kitchen.<br /><br />The one in the kitchen is an APC Back-Ups Pro 500 that I bought in 2002 at CompUSA when they were still around.   Of the almost 25 years I've had it there were maybe 8-10 where it wasn't plugged in and had no battery in it.  I'd upgraded to a Back-Ups Pro 1500.  The 1500 eventually died (capacitors on the circuit board went bad) so it was scrapped and replaced by one from CyberPower.<br /><br />Most of these units have had their batteries replaced at least once, some several times.  On average I get maybe 2 to 3 years out of the batteries.  It really depends on how often there are major power issues where the unit ends up running for an extended time as opposed to kicking in for a minute or two for a "brown out."<br /><br />We have a rack mount unit from APC at work, I've replaced the batteries on it 2 or 3 times over the last 6 years.  It takes eight 12V batteries that are wired up as 2 groups of 4 batteries in series with the two groups in parallel.  The battery assembly for there is in a metal tray that can be hot swapped from the UPS when needed.<br /><br />To get a spare tray and batteries with all the wiring was around $500 when I checked on it back in 2019 or so.  Pulling the batteries out of the tray and making a run over to Batteries and Bulbs got me 8 new batteries for about $250 or so.  Just did them again a couple months back and just the batteries ran me around $375 this time.<br /><br />I've been doing the same thing with my home units going back into the early 2000s.  I pull the battery pack, figure out what connects to what, what parts I need to keep, etc. then run the old batteries over to Batteries and Bulbs to recycle as I buy a new set.<br /><br />You don't have to buy your batteries from the manufacturer and you don't need to pay for the wires, mounts, connectors, etc. that come with their battery pack.  You already have all that crap on your old battery pack.<br /><br />I did a little hunting around on YouTube and this is one of the better videos I've found showing what I'm talking about.  The guy pulls the battery pack, separates the batteries from the wiring and connectors, and swaps in new batteries.  All you really need is a little time, maybe a pair of pliers and a screwdriver, and a roll of duct tape or electrical tape.  Take the old batteries to whoever recycles them and get however many you need with the equivalent specs to replace them.<br /><br />I've been running the Duracell equivalent of the OEM batteries on my units here for many years with no issues and they don't cost me anywhere near what ordering the entire battery pack from the manufacturer would.<br /><br />I just finished replacing the single 12V battery in the Back-Ups Pro 500 in the kitchen today and thought I'd pass some of this information along to maybe save some of you a few bucks too.  Even a small battery back up that gives you time to shut things off properly when the power goes out is useful and they also double as surge protectors.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycm6snFAbjQ" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span>youtube.com/watch?v=ycm6snFAbjQ<span class="invisible"></span></a>

Big Tech "Capitalism" = Central Planning And "Free Markets" Are A Myth As The U.S. Financial Crash Is Imminent<br />We are seeing the collapse of the U.S. financial system drawing closer and closer each day. Last year, the only thing that supported the U.S. financial system and stopped it from completely collapsing, was investment into AI and the 7 technology stocks, referred to as the "Magnificent 7". Today, as we head into the last couple of weeks of the First Quarter in 2024, many of those "Magnificent 7" stocks are beginning to fall back from the AI bubble created in 2023, and there is now really only one of these stocks that has been basically stopping a full stock market crash, Nvidia, the leading manufacturer for the power-hungry computer processors needed to run AI. Nvidia is now worth more than all of these companies combined: AT&amp;T, Boeing, Coca-Cola, Disney, FedEx, General Motors, IBM, McDonald’s, Nike, Starbucks, UPS, and Walmart. Nvidia recently reached a $2 trillion market value and has easily beat the previous most valued Big Tech company, Apple. Apple's valuation continues to decline, along with other Big Tech companies like Tesla, partly because of their dependence on the China market. And many investors are wise enough to see that Nvidia's current valuation is also a huge bubble that is going to burst. Besides Nvidia, the other "product" that is holding up the financial system right now is the new Bitcoin ETF that the SEC approved recently.<br />by Brian Shilhavy<br /><a href="https://healthimpactnews.com/2024/big-tech-capitalism-central-planning-and-free-markets-are-a-myth-as-the-u-s-financial-crash-is-imminent" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://</span>healthimpactnews.com/2024/big-tech-capitalism<span class="invisible">-central-planning-and-free-markets-are-a-myth-as-the-u-s-financial-crash-is-imminent</span><span class="ellipsis"></span></a>
<p>Update to my build (happy birthday to me)...</p><p>These parts are on the way:</p><p><strong>Asus ROG Strix Z790-E</strong> motherboard. Hard to ignore a brand that I&#39;ve had for well over 20 years that runs perfect to this day. Not one failure from any of my builds.</p><p><strong>Intel i9-3900KF CPU.</strong> There wasn&#39;t a huge difference between the 13900 and 14900 and like you said - put that difference on the GPU.</p><p><strong>Corsair Vengeance RAM</strong> (2x32 to start - more later if needed),<br /><strong>Gigabyte Radeon 7600XT GPU</strong>. I read that the Gigabyte&#39;s have the least &#39;coil whine&#39;. And it&#39;s a Radeon that I&#39;ve used in the past with no issues. I&#39;ve had my share of trouble with Nvidia.</p><p><strong>Crucial T500 2TB, SSD</strong>. It&#39;s a bit faster and $20 cheaper than the Western Digital I was considering and I didn&#39;t want to wait almost a month to get it.</p><p><strong>Corsair 1000w PSU</strong>. No worries about power shortages. EVER!<br /><strong>Phanteks Enthoo Pro case</strong>. Huge inside. It will be fun trying to fill it!</p><p>-</p><p>I have not chosen a cooler yet. I&#39;m looking pretty hard at the Noctua NH-D15. Thousands have bought it with excellent results, so that&#39;s hard to ignore. My only concern is it fitting this board. Some say they&#39;ve had trouble mainly with their RAM slots getting crowded into. I&#39;m looking at specs now. Pretty sure it will fit though.</p><p>I also read somewhere that Asus recommends an AIO for this board and CPU, but maybe I&#39;m too set in my ways for old-school parts? I&#39;d like to try the AIO&#39;s but like most parts - just so many choices and just as many reviews good and bad. They are pretty much all the same except the pump. Obviously you don&#39;t want to chimp-out here. So do you spend $65 or $200 on an AIO?  Meh... maybe I&#39;ll try one down the road or if I find a deal I can&#39;t pass up. </p><p>I even considered making m own cooler in my machine shop. That might be fun! Maybe use the parts from an old air conditioner. I&#39;ve seen some people DIY these. Yes, WAY overkill, but what else can this retired machinist do for boredom? :) I always liked re-purposing stuff.</p><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had an old-school fan-type cooler ever fail. I think I had one with a noisy fan, but it was easily replaced. I&#39;ve had more GPU fans fail than anything else. Usually dust contamination. </p>

Well, Plasma 6 was just pushed out on Archlinux.  Looking very nice.  Of course the default Wayland is causing issues with Nvidia GPU's but not near to the degree that it used to.  In fact, it is basically fixed.  Other than that, Plasma 6 is looking nice.  Still figuring out all the upgrades.

<a href="https://gab.com/EthanJenkins" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@EthanJenkins</a> Years ago AMD manufactured their own graphics cards. Now they license out the tech similar to how Nvidia does. I remember the early 2000s when it was ATI before CPU maker AMD bought them.
The recent dominance of Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia, along with Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla – the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks – is indicative of “a fundamental shift”, primarily propelled by advancements in AI.<br /><br />Just thought you might want to know your real enemies!
<a href="https://gab.com/PlagueDr" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@PlagueDr</a> It's an interesting industry what with NVidia being one of the biggest companies on the planet, right up there with Intel or Apple. EVGA made great cards, but they didn't produce the chips, which put them (and others) in a tight place.
".... Tesla’s been sliding all year. So has Apple. Microsoft and Alphabet have been struggling over the past month, but Amazon and Nvidia carried them all. Today, Apple plunged over troubles in China and pulled all the other leaders down with it, except Nvidia ... <br /><br />I personally believe it will take a big event to rip the momentum out of this market, such as a much bigger spike in inflation than we’ve seen that makes it clear to everyone that the Fed has a lot of work ahead of it still or another banking bust like we saw last spring. It’s bound to take a jolt, but once the momentum turns down, a lot will get pulled down with the sinking ship. That, of course, could happen this month as CRE troubles keep building and bank safety programs and reserve cash set-asides (reverse repo loans with the Fed) run out in March." <br /><a href="https://www.thedailydoom.com/p/are-stocks-facing-a-titanic-crash" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span>thedailydoom.com/p/are-stocks-facing-a-titani<span class="invisible">c-crash</span><span class="ellipsis"></span></a>

Who would trust Torba now?<br /><br />Many people can see it’s not about the storage. He is using the financial support from Gab social to fund AI project. Bait and Switch. The guy blew all the money on AI - AI imaging files are really big, NVIDIA graphic cards are expensive. Then he is going bat shit crazy on us about money as if we owe him. <br /><br />He has shown his true color, shit character.
<a href="https://gab.com/Bubba03" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@Bubba03</a> Mr. T blew money on AI (expensive NVIDIA graphics cards, etc). The AI imaging, files tend to be really huge. It costs money to storage AI generated images. The boomers' photos of dogs and card are not the problem AT ALL. That's why you can argue with Mr. T like "but but... we can delete our photos, or set an expiration date." He doesn't care. He wants people to pony up (funding for his AI project).<br /><br />It's a bait and switch. The owner of the platform has already moved on to the next venture, AI business. He is using paid users on Gab social to fund his AI project. Maybe the remaining users should move on too. It is only a matter of time.
<a href="https://gab.com/BigDigEnergy" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@BigDigEnergy</a> <br />It is never about storage. It is about his AI venture. Mr. T keeps pissing away money on his side projects such as AI (expensive NVIDIA graphics cards, etc.)<br /><br />The people are paying to fund a social media site, a community. No one is trying to fund his dream of selling AI product to tech billionaires. Basic features on Gab are still choking, not seamless. Money is not spent on improving the basic features of the site. This is a bait and switch. His shaming retirees and Christians for not paying to fund his AI dream is bullshit.<br /><br />If you look at his Twitter account. Almost everything he posts is about AI. The whole account is like a sales pitch of AI to Elon Musk. It is embarrassing. As if Elon Musk is going to be impressed by his frugal Al. He is delusional to think his frugal AI is going to beat Microsoft or Google.<br /><br />His credibility is shot. Nobody will trust him now. Mr. T has already moved on to his AI, he is just using Gab socials to fund his AI projects.
EdgeCloud for Mobile — unleashing AI computing on 3.9 billion Android devices<br />Theta Labs<br />Theta EdgeCloud and the 10,000+ active Edge Nodes around the world are the backbone that allows Theta to deliver fast, cost-effective compute work for AI and video applications over a decentralized network. As the Theta engineering team continues its core development of EdgeCloud for its first release on May 1, a separate and parallel R&amp;D track is under way to launch a pilot of the Theta Edge Node for mobile Android devices in the next few months.<br />The goal of this initial pilot is to test the feasibility of leveraging up to 3.9 Billion active Google Android devices for certain types of AI computation workloads. Android today accounts for 70% of the mobile operating system market share across 190 countries, and provides an ideal platform to evaluate mobile CPU/GPU capabilities.<br />This also sets up the opportunity to target over 150 million active Android TVs globally that run the AndroidTV operating system from Sony, Sharp, Phillips and many more brands. While the average daily consumption of television today is around 3 hours, this leaves the device available the majority of the time for other types of computation and data sharing, especially as these always connected Smart TVs increase CPU and GPU capabilities over the next decade.<br />While intensive compute work is generally not feasible on mobile devices today, that is changing quickly. For example, TensorFlow Lite now enables on-device machine learning by allowing developers to run their trained models on mobile, embedded, and IoT devices and computers. It supports platforms such as embedded Linux, Android, iOS, and MCU. In the near future, these devices will be able to process more and more complex computations, and therefore become significantly more valuable as nodes on Theta EdgeCloud. Today’s devices can already run certain types of jobs on the Theta Edge Node, making the 3.9 billion Android devices worldwide a massive potential addition to Theta EdgeCloud. In the future, with the ability to serve GenAI, LLM inference, and text-to-image among other use cases, mobile devices running Edge Nodes can serve an AI market valued at $200 billion today, and projected to be worth more than $1 trillion in 2028.<br />The opportunity is to shift compute-intensive AI workloads to the edge as the cost of centralized GPU resources skyrocket from all the major cloud service providers, but this remains a challenging technical problem. For example, NVIDIA recently announced a private AI chat bot for desktops running RTX on Windows PCs equipped with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 and 40 Series GPUs with at least 8GB of VRAM. Theta EdgeCloud when fully launched in 2025 aims to seamlessly integrate high-end GPU capability from cloud providers with billions of mobile and smart devices in addition to desktops and laptops into a unified AI infrastructure layer. This opens up a vast market to process on-demand AI workloads optimized for cost, quality of service, privacy and device capabilities.<br />The Theta engineering team is excited to initially test with Google’s new experimental MediaPipe on device text-to-image generation solution for Android in the pilot launch of mobile Theta Edge node. The team is evaluating text-to-image generation based on text prompts using standard diffusion models as well as customized text-to-image generation based on text prompts using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights. “Creating LoRA weights requires training a foundation model on images of a specific object, person, or style, which enables the model to recognize the new concept and apply it when generating images,” according to Google developer site.<br />The Theta team hopes you are as excited about this opportunity as we are, and invite you to participate in this pilot, share your feedback and resources as we continue to break new grounds in next-generation AI computing. As a final note, the initial expectation is that TFUEL staking will not be supported on Edge Node mobile pilot, and will be solely used for compute testing in this feasibility study.<br />Theta Labs<br /><a href="https://thetalabs.medium.com/edgecloud-for-mobile-unleashing-ai-computing-on-3-9-billion-android-devices-7f07f02637f9" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://</span>thetalabs.medium.com/edgecloud-for-mobile-unl<span class="invisible">eashing-ai-computing-on-3-9-billion-android-devices-7f07f02637f9</span><span class="ellipsis"></span></a>

Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang on Friday said that artificial general intelligence could — by some definitions — arrive in as little as five years.<br /><br />Huang, who heads the world's leading maker of artificial intelligence chips used to create systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT, was responding to a question at an economic forum held at Stanford University about how long it would take to achieve one of Silicon Valley's long-held goals of creating computers that can think like humans.<br /><br />Huang said that the answer largely depends on how the goal is defined. If the definition is the ability to pass human tests, Huang said, artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive soon.  <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/03/02/tech/nvidia-ceo-ai-humans/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span>japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/03/02/tech/nvi<span class="invisible">dia-ceo-ai-humans/</span><span class="ellipsis"></span></a>

I think I've dropped my accumulated schizo ramblings on here before but here's a refresher for fun:<br /><br /><a href="/tags/BTC" class="" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$BTC</a> is a great indicator for crypto as a whole. Usually, not always, but usually, if you see BTC rise, eventually people will take profit and invest it in altcoins, which in turn rise. Exchanges facilitate easy value transfer between cryptos, as it becomes more time-consuming to off-ramp and buy other financial investments like stocks.<br /><br />Crypto, as a space, is currently taking off. It hasn't exactly gone to the moon yet, but, like the last march of the ents, there's the notion that this could be the last crypto moonshot. Why? Institutional investment.<br /><br />Crypto is a relatively new technology. Most of its use cases have been relegated to "store of value" (like a black lotus from magic, it's valuable because enough people decided it is) or shitty NFT jpgs of monkeypunks. But what if the technologies were adopted to tangible use-cases? NFT's which prove titles and deeds and licenses? Perfectly auditable ledgers which processing fees are cheaper than credit cards at speed and at scale? Instantaneous cross-border payments with pennies in transaction fees compared to multiple days plus heavy fees today? Tokenization of existing instruments so that you can, for example,  but $100 worth of Nvidia instead of being locked out of shares without a decent chunk of change?<br /><br />That's the future of crypto - real world use cases. Those are coming online. It's inevitable as long as humans progress intellectually. Whether it's a flip of a switch or a gradual climb, it's coming. So, the best strategy would be to buy a little bit of everything shilled here, even psychopoasters' stinky linky, and spread out the risk of one not taking off while the rest of the market does.<br /><br />ICP, LINK, SOL, AVAX, CSPR, XRP, THETA, ALPH, PEPE even (personally I'm meme-coin agnostic but I can't deny I missed PEPE thrice). All and more will likely climb wildly as institutions come into the space, which forces more retail into the space, which drives prices up, and the late movers across Q4 '24 all the way to 2030 are buying our heavy bags and making us rich, because we have the tokens everyone needs to operate in the new financial world. It's literally just trying to determine which of all of them will have the highest multiplier.<br /><br />Those are the ones that become the Apple or Microsoft of crypto, and I think it's whatever one gets the most buy-in for tokenized real-world assets. Crypto as a whole is, what, <a href="/tags/2T" class="" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$2T</a>? If it captures 1% of the derivatives market, then it becomes valued at <a href="/tags/12T" class="" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$12T</a>. 1%. That's the moonshot of all moonshots, and it only fires once. (That's my schizoist rambling, but it's fucking dramatic, right?!)<br /><br />And BTC halving is a simple supply and demand: the rewards from mining are cut in half, the liquid Bitcoin flowing into the space is cut in half, holders hold, buyers want in, there's less supply, price goes up, econ 101. It's predictable and it's this year.<br /><br />WAGMI

WallStreetSilv<br />CEO of Nvidia argues that we should stop teaching kids computer science and how to code; AI will do it instead.

<a href="https://gab.com/acapaaron" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@acapaaron</a> <br /><br />You are correct, it all costs money.  However, you and I know the AI project is one huge sucking sound of resources, as AI really needs GPU processing.  Storage space is cheap, where 200 PB SSD system, if I recall correctly at one of my installations was around $40,000, compared to an Nvidia DGX GPU install was around $21,000,000 for 32 GPU nodes, and around $67,000,000 for 126 GPU nodes system.  Each GPU is around $400,000.  Power for the GPUs are 6kW, with another 3kW for supporting equipment per GPU node.  The power a node uses in a day is far more than most people use in a month in their housing, except for maybe Gore.  <br /><br />Here is the issue, his AI is a novelty, which many on this platform could not give a rat's ass about. The storage excuse is a specious argument, for it is truly cheap.  Frankly, his ego will chase people away where advertisers cannot justify the expenditure, in an attempt to justify and support his AI adventure.

Storage is CHEAP, where 200 PB (i.e., 200,000 TB) SSD hardware is in the $40,000 range, and not very power hungry.    <br /><br />As an idea, for comparison, AI computing power is extremely expensive.  Temporary gigs I have installed Nvidia DGX GPU server systems, from 32 to 126 GPU nodes.  Each GPU node is roughly $400,000, then depending on configuration, the support equipment is another $100,000.  Then there is the power, where the GPU uses approximately 6kW, plus another 2-3 kW for each support system.  Thus, each GPU uses as much power in a day than many houses use in a month.  The power costs are through the roof!!!  Standard server farms are nowhere near as expensive, both in hardware and power consumption.  <br /><br />Here is another fact, Gab limits sizes of files, which reduces total storage size.  I would wager, Gab has not exceeded 1 PB.  <br /><br />In conclusion, when <a href="https://gab.com/a" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@a</a> starts yammering on about cost, look to the AI portion, as it is very expensive, not the storage.

The worlds leading tech CEO says humans no longer needed in coding/tech, AI has made them obsolete<br /><br /><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/nvidia-ceo-claims-nobody-needs-to-learn-to-program-anymore-thanks-to-ai/ar-BB1iVzuz" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span>msn.com/en-us/news/technology/nvidia-ceo-clai<span class="invisible">ms-nobody-needs-to-learn-to-program-anymore-thanks-to-ai/ar-BB1iVzuz</span><span class="ellipsis"></span></a><br /><br />Recent statements by Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, have added fuel to the more than hot debate about artificial intelligence and how it can replace or delete jobs like that of a programmer. Huang, co-founder of the company, is clear: In the near future no one will have to program anymore, since AI will do almost everything for us.<br /><br />According to the CEO of Nvidia, in the future no one will have to program<br /><br />These statements have been controversial and have both supporters and detractors. The reasoning of the director of the technology company is that, while a few years ago personalities in the sector have recommended that children learn computing and programming, Huang believes that in the future it should be the opposite. He said that “It is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human”, and instead, he recommends that new generations become experts in any other specialized subject.<br /><br />According to Jensen Huang, Artificial intelligence will reach a point where professions such as computer programming will be redundant before the tools and facilities that AIs will offer. The CEO of Nvidia believes that the ideal is that, given the emergence of these tools,there are more experts in any other field such as education, biology, or finance, as thanks to the refinement of artificial intelligence they will be able to be more efficient in their work and research.<br /><br />As we mentioned above, these statements have both supporters and detractors. Several of those who are in favor simply agree with him, while those who are against provide arguments such as that”the fact programmers are highly paid is a bug corporations will try to fix with automation even if the end result is lower quality.” Others directly mock Huang’s point of view as if someone in the Middle Ages claimed that “Thanks to the printing press, children will be able to stop learning to write”.<br /><br />What Huang’s statements do not take into account is the fact that learning any programming language is not only useful for the result itself, but it also has positive influences for programmers such as developing problem-solving or improving syntax capabilities.<br /><br />In mid-February 2024, Nvidia became the fourth most valuable company in the world overtaking giants like Alphabet (Google) and Amazon, thanks to their hardware intended for other large technology companies focused on the creation and research of artificial intelligence. This, according to many, would be another of the main reasons for Huang’s statements, since the ulterior motive for these statements would be precisely to please their investors and shareholders.

<a href="https://gab.com/Riddler73" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@Riddler73</a> A bit of geopolitics.<br />America sold its soul to China to bring down the Soviet Union.<br />It had the petrodollar in place (dominance) and would outsource for cheap manpower. It was also part of the forever dominance (globalization to tie that dominance).<br />What is happening is a rebellion, not a punishment. <br />It's like a strike.<br />Because neither China nor America can properly divorce.<br />They are SIAMESE. One has the liver and the other the legs.<br /><br />You are reading this in the wrong way.<br />America took from Britain (Pax Americana) the head of the 'Global power'<br />but London never ceased being the real head (Banks and the hidden hand)<br />Israel was created and existed to have the nukes of the final day to be pointed at Moscow. And that is WRITTEN. Samson doctrine is exactly that.<br />They cannot give up ISrael and will do anything to keep it because the moment it's lost (especially with Moscow having hypersonics) all goes to shit.<br />Ukraine is the same case.<br />The objective is Russia and its resources.<br />China and America are far from being enemies. China is making the price to help America re: Russia way higher. They are betting every chip (literally).<br />What Trump did (he has, like you, a fixation) was pushing China against a wall and the 'globalist ties' (such as WEF) were cut de facto because the motherfucker thought he was smarter than them and started the fake trade war to boast but in reality what he wanted is the crisis China is suffering now and getting Iran for Israel. Chisrael resisted (that's another organ they share, Israel).<br />However he was imbecile and arrogant enough to fuck Xi with Covid, to fuck with Xi attacking him (America can live without legs, but China cannot without LIVER -aka big market-)<br />So what did that get. Everything America was doing to fuck China (the 'invisible war' in the pressers) backfired because Putin, who is significantly more intelligent than them had a process going to ensure Russia's salvation in the China/US pincer organized. Primakov's doctrine.<br />When Trump (and Biden, who is one of the Chinese minion intermediaries, just watch him begging in comms two nights ago) pushed XI, Russia made a more reasonable offer.<br />This is not the first time China retreats from Globalization. They did centuries ago, all of a sudden, they brought back the ships and shut themselves down.<br />Now Xi is slowly undoing his bubble. They have 5 years ahead of crisis. Putin will help. Xi cannot longer pincer because he is in need not all the way around.<br />Putin has made China retreat from many places in Africa without taking them for Russia (loyalty). He has organized a massive denial of resources to the looters (YOU). <br />China would like to go to the ole' WEF times but he can't.<br />Now we have the Nvidia situation (meant to crush China, the chips act)<br />That's the war.<br />America and Russia can go autarkic. China will never be able unless it takes Russia.<br />It's a very weird situation you still don't understand well because your priors are stuck. Reality is weirder and way more KABUKI than you make it.<br />The punishment is not coming from China.<br />China was using the diaspora to steal secrets for their development. China is a big country with people quickly aging, the results of Ford's ONE CHILD mandate /it was fucking Ford, not the Chinese, it was the Americans who put that as a condition in the Nixon era/. That's another of your sneaky nasty maneuvers coming back to bite your arse.<br />America is not being punished. America is being boomeranged<br />America is wanting to divorce by cutting itself the legs or making the legs by crushing the siamese body. It was Trump launching the all-war against their partner. Xi stayed many days in Mar a Lago. Xi's daughter was under Trump's care in the US.<br />The person who is changing everything to SURVIVE is Putin.<br />Multipolarity is intelligent but it takes courage to finally leave the hegemonic pedestal, lick the wounds, fix the country. It's very humiliating because it's humbling and you will not be able to fight an easy war ever again.<br />That's the problem.<br />If we make it through the next months, things will improve for all at the end.<br />Everyone at their own home fixing their own problems and cordially trading under new, better rules.<br />There's no other way.<br />It's the Good, bad and the ugly duel. First to jump dies.

<a href="https://gab.com/otiswoe" class="mention" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@otiswoe</a> It would depend on the age of your hardware. New kernels don't fully support some older hardware, so newer isn't always better. For instance, I have an 32-bit server with an older Nvidia card installed that will not work the way I want with any kernels above 4.19 due to the kernel not supporting the older Nvidia driver, as I prefer using Nvidia's driver plug-in with Compiz over the Nouveau.<br />If you haven't installed anything yet, go ahead with Debian 12 and see if you can get all your hardware working properly. If not, go back a version level. It's always possible that, in the future, kernels might support the old hardware but, unless a lot of people want it, probably not.

In a remarkably short period of 92 days, Pelosi amassed a profit of approximately $1,800,000, equivalent to ten years’ worth of her political salary of $175,000 per annum. This substantial return on investment has intensified scrutiny, with questions arising about the potential influence of Pelosi’s political position on her stock trading decisions.<br /><br />Pelosi’s knack for strategically timed stock trades has prompted concerns, suggesting the possibility of leveraging insider knowledge derived from her political role. In 2023, her investments yielded a remarkable 65 percent return, outperforming the S&amp;P 500’s overall gain of 24 percent. Such disparities fueled calls from within her own party to advocate for a ban on stock trading by congressional members. Despite initial resistance from Pelosi, the push for such a ban led Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) to introduce the PELOSI Act, aiming to prevent elected officials from owning securities and investments. However, the bill is yet to secure passage.<br /><br />Pelosi’s considerable wealth positions her as one of the most affluent members of Congress, boasting a combined net worth of around $46 million with her husband, Paul. While Pelosi contends that stock discussions do not occur with her investment banking spouse, revelations from video footage in her daughter’s documentary suggest otherwise, indicating that Paul is frequently present during her business-related phone calls.<br /><br />The intersection of political influence, financial gains, and calls for legislative restrictions underscores the ongoing debate surrounding the ethical considerations of congressional members engaging in stock trading. The conservative perspective on Pelosi’s financial maneuvers emphasizes the need for transparency and ethical conduct among elected officials to maintain public trust.<br /><br /><a href="https://con-alerts.com/alarm-bells-pelosis-huge-stock-trades-spark-serious-concerns/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://</span>con-alerts.com/alarm-bells-pelosis-huge-stock<span class="invisible">-trades-spark-serious-concerns/</span><span class="ellipsis"></span></a>

First off, GDP is annual added value, next year they have the same one or bigger... a countrys assets are ludicrous and almost unmeasurable, the regular land assets alone are quadrillions. This is why its nuts for Ukraine to sell its land to blackrock for $1 an acre.<br /><br />Second, stock value isnt real value. Eg if nvidia sells 10% stocks, the remaining 90% are worth less, because any sale of stock signals that the stock is worth less. And the crash is not linear, its geometric. Eg selling the next 10% off will make the 80% thats left reduce in price per share MORE than selling the first 10%. It wouldnt be weird if only a fraction of the original company value is extracted.<br /><br />This is why Elon was fucking nuts to buy twitter like he did. The cheaper way to do it is slowly over years buy the largest single piece, and always vote for the worst decision so the stock plummets, then buy up the rest slowly at a lower cost. Thats what the kikes do anyway.<br /><br />The real value of a company can be something like the physical assets, the profits for 2.5 years, and a reasonable estimate of stock value if sold, minus all of the liabilities.

ONE MANS OPINION ……. I love it when a plan comes together. Mid morning of this past Tuesday, Feb 20, 2024 I posted that both Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) had taken a hit and both had their price per share drop in price. I recommended considering both for purchase. At the close of business Friday, AMD was up $11.00 +/- and NVDA was up $98.00 +/- per share and NVDA. Latest price target for AMD is $270/ share with NVDA at $835.00 /share (although some project the target of $1,000.00/ share) indicating both have more room to increase in value (price). Buy on weakness, but only in increments of 35% maximum of what your gut says. “Limit Orders” only. Do your own research and if it doesn’t fit your investing profile, don’t buy it.
