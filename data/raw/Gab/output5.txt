With that in mind, let’s examine some of the financial fundamentals.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn case you need to get up to speed, TMTG (as I’ll call it) is the parent company of Truth Social, the social network founded in 2021 by Donald Trump. In October 2021, it agreed to merge into Digital World Acquisition Corp., a blank-check company. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBlank-check companies — or SPACs, as they are also known — enjoyed a brief moment back in 2021 as a way for companies to go public without much scrutiny of their finances. They simply merged into publicly traded firms with no operations that were sitting on a big pile of cash that investors had more or less blindly trusted the board to invest wisely. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd reader, it often didn’t end well. By the end of 2023, at least 21 companies that went public through SPAC mergers have gone bankrupt. In total, SPACs lost investors — often retail stock buyers — some $46 billion from the peak of their valuations.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOn Tuesday, TMTG became a public company after its merger was finally approved last week. And when the shares started trading in New York with the ticker DJT, they jumped 42% to $70.90. That valued the company at $9.6 billion. By the close of regular trading, the shares had come back down to $57.99, which added about $650 million to Trump’s net worth because of his ownership stake, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhich brings us to the fundamentals. Based on that opening share price, TMTG is likely valued at more than 2,000 times annual revenue — taking the reported $3.4 million in nine-month sales and estimating for the year. Now, tech companies are often afforded generous valuations based on the assumption of rapid growth and the promise of future riches – or at least they were before interest rates increased.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut let’s put that multiple of sales in some context: Nvidia Corp., the hit stock of the artificial intelligence revolution, is valued at just 38 times sales. When the preeminent social media platform of the past two decades, Facebook Inc. (now Meta Platforms Inc.) went public in 2012, it was valued at 12.5 times revenue. The only similar point of comparison that springs to mind is Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp, which at the time had little revenue to speak of, for $19 billion in 2014.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhatsApp did, of course, have a lot of users, though. About 450 million, at the time. TMTG doesn’t actually report the number of active users, though it said in a January regulatory filing that it has had “9.0 million signups for Truth Social via iOS, Android and the web.” Generously, each of those users is therefore afforded $1,067 in value. Meta is currently valued at $422 per monthly active Facebook user. It’s highly likely, however, that only a fraction of the signups to Truth Social use the app anything like monthly.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd we haven’t even mentioned Trump Media’s reported $49 million loss in the nine months ending in September. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAll of which might explain why Trump Media is now the most expensive US stock to bet against, as Bloomberg News reported. There’s not much stock available (the number of shares being traded is pretty low), and lots of people think it’s overvalued. In other words, it’s a meme stock. —Alex Webb","media_attachments":[],"reblog":null,"quote":null,"account":{"id":"6300151","username":"Seize_the_Day","acct":"Seize_the_Day","display_name":"Reagan is my Hero","locked":false,"created_at":"2023-04-16T16:40:28.532Z","note":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://gab.com/Seize_the_Day","avatar":"https://gab.com/avatars/original/missing.png","avatar_static":"https://gab.com/avatars/original/missing.png","avatar_small":"https://gab.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=40,fit=scale-down/avatars/original/missing.png","avatar_static_small":"https://gab.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=40,fit=scale-down/avatars/original/missing.png","header":"https://gab.com/headers/original/missing.png","header_static":"https://gab.com/headers/original/missing.png","is_spam":false,"followers_count":16,"following_count":22,"statuses_count":12295,"is_pro":false,"is_verified":false,"is_donor":false,"is_investor":false,"show_pro_life":false,"is_parody":null,"emojis":[],"fields":[]},"group":null,"status_context":null,"mentions":[],"tags":[],"emojis":[],"card":null,"poll":null},{"id":"112173276340053193","created_at":"2024-03-28T12:19:22.139Z","revised_at":null,"in_reply_to_id":null,"in_reply_to_account_id":null,"sensitive":false,"spoiler_text":"","visibility":"public","language":"en","uri":"/fv3nslc/posts/112173276340053193","url":"https://gab.com/fv3nslc/posts/112173276340053193","direct_replies_count":9,"replies_count":16,"reblogs_count":1,"pinnable":false,"pinnable_by_group":true,"favourites_count":6,"quote_of_id":null,"expires_at":null,"has_quote":false,"bookmark_collection_id":null,"quotes_count":0,"reaction_id":null,"reactions_counts":{"1":6},"is_reply":false,"account_id":"2301518","media_attachment_ids":[],"conversation_id":"11063738231595440","reblog_of_id":null,"group_id":"661","status_context_id":null,"preview_card_id":null,"poll_id":null,"reply_group":"all","content":"I have an older computer with an Intel I7 2.66 Ghz (4 core), Nvidia GeForce GTX 970, running Windows 10 and was curious what older version of Blender I should to dabble into 3d printing.

government will no longer buy Intel or AMD chips, or Microsoft products, for its PCs \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eChina's government has reportedly started enforcing a new law that it passed in December this week. The law bans the government from purchasing PCs with Intel and AMD ﻿chips inside, along with software products from Microsoft, including its Windows operating system.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAccording to The Financial Times (via PC World), the new rules on purchasing products for China's government PCs were set in place in December by the country's Information Technology Security Evaluation Center. They include all governments and agencies above what is considered to be the country's township level.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eChina previously ordered its government offices and agencies to no longer use Microsoft's Windows OS in 2022, in favor of a homegrown Linux-based OS. As a result, these new guidelines are not expected to affect Microsoft. However, the ban on Intel and AMD chips could result in a noticeable hit in the revenue numbers for both companies.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOn the other hand, the ban on these products on China's government PCs does not include their use in private businesses or by regular consumers in that country.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eChina previously banned the use of Apple's iPhone products in its government buildings. It has also banned the use of products from Micron Technology for its infrastructure projects, citing security concerns.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThese new moves come sometime after the United States government banned China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) from exporting fabrication equipment to make certain chips in that country.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLate in 2023, the US government banned the export of some of Nvidia's AI GPUs to China. Nvidia has instead developed AI chips, the H20, that were specifically made to conform to the restrictions of the US government's export rules. The company started taking preorders for the H20 chips in early 2024, and are expected to begin large scale shipments of those China-specific AI GPUs sometime in the second quarter of 2024.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.neowin.net/news/chinas-government-will-no-longer-buy-intel-or-amd-chips-or-microsoft-products-for-its-pcs/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"invisible\"\u003ehttps://www.\u003c/span\u003eneowin.net/news/chinas-government-will-no-lon\u003cspan class=\"invisible\"\u003eger-buy-intel-or-amd-chips-or-microsoft-products-for-its-pcs/\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"ellipsis\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e","media_attachments":[],"reblog":null,"quote":null,"account":{"id":"3442269","username":"MikeL90633923","acct":"MikeL90633923","display_name":"Mike L 🇺🇸 🇮🇹 🇺🇸","locked":false,"created_at":"2021-01-12T22:13:48.602Z","note":"\u003cp\u003eRegistered Republican:  Closest party for a conservative.
