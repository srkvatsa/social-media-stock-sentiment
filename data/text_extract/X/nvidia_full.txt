1/n: Lets look at their latest 10-K: https://t.co/cxDRs9XdGy
they reported 47.5 B revenue. Assuming 30K price for their GPU card (which of course has many other components), makes it 1.5mln GPU units shipped in the last 12 months. Lets round it to 1mln@Dogetoshi We need NVIDIA to start using 90% of their GPU output for mining Bitcoin on their own and keep them on their balance sheet. 

So that GPU prices, NVDA sales, share price and Bitscoin all go to infinity!久々にXに戻ってきたら $SMCI とかいう謎の会社が $NVDA と同レベルでTLに流れてくるけど何者！？@alphatrends Great call.

Stop the crying already!@JoeBoat2012 JB , how do you feel now that the $NVDA hype has deflated out of the stock? So much for PAY-tience. $NNOX needs to communicate some updates to it’s shareholders.

I wouldn’t usually leave a winner of this magnitude, in fact, the best investment I’ve ever owned, but my research and math led me to take action. 

Not wrong, but early.@squawksquare So just to give you an idea of relative valuations, for the next year:
- $NVDA has a PE fwrd 33x, with a growing net margin of roughly 50% 
- $TSLA is 65x, with a DECREASING net margin equal to 3.12% ‼️🚨
So why $TSLA is still twice as expensive as $NVDA?Going to start documenting my investments. I wish I done this sooner. The returns don’t represent my actual returns due to selling and rebuying, £3200 invested and up around £1000 at the moment.

Now idk who needs to hear this but all I’m going to say is, if you see Bulls support 785.23 CONVINCINGLY we most likely see 826.44

That would be an interesting, and surely, actionable comparisonDurante el 4T24 los ingresos por servidores fueron USD18,4bn, avanzando un 27% t/t. 

La mayoría de estos ingresos vino de la mano de las grandes compañías de Cloud. Además, el directorio de $NVDA estima que el 40% de estos ingresos se atribuyen a la ejecución de modelos de #AI. https://t.co/9rKKLC5MDy$NVDA: ingresos récord, resultados récord

2連ストップ高級の急騰にオハギャーです☀️@ArthurB Isn't the mystery why NVDA is up so much *relative to the rest of the value chain*?

Maybe Nvidia really will capture all the value ("in this corner of the possibility space")

But isn't the Occam's razor that it's a meme stock, a la TSLA? https://t.co/Gv6qhdP3Dh@MrtnzAlvrz El mayor asset de NVDA es CUDA, la infraestructura de software, es prácticamente omnipresente. Hace muy difícil trasladar los modelos a otras GPUs, network effect muy difícil de romper.

Long Nvidia (y eso que acabo de vender un poco para rebalancear mi portfolio)@Cannabis_Cane I used to trade that 3am-6am /ES move. But with reality being big tech is the last thing churning up hard, reminds me of the 1st tech bubble, it was bad and this one is going to hurt.

Looking ahead there’s no reason Tesla won’t maintain a data advantage for awhile.

Demand is fine

$SPX $SPY $AAPL $AMZN $BA $META $NVDA $NFLX $MSFT $TSLA@The_AI_Investor To some extent yes. But it also depends on how quickly competition can close the gap. There are a million variables.

This feels like a great $500 stockI feel like anyone calling NVDA a bubble hasn’t looked at the fact its earnings are growing faster than its stock price 

It’s growing into its valuation.

"Then from 22-Feb Venus in own term *should* help the tech love - all depends on NVDA though!"@SatoshiFlipper Boomers and NVDA heating up Wall Street! 📈🔥🚀 Nvidia's earnings call left bears in the dust with a whopping $22.1B in revenue.

Nvidia $NVDA surged 15% ↑ ($100) smashing expectations by 12% ↑! 
The AI frenzy is fueling unprecedented growth. 

But what do you think - is Nvidia a smart buy in this booming AI market, or is https://t.co/uOgaP85mlB+$500 PROFIT per contract 

Alerted for FREE in Discord yesterday. 

We do this every day. 🎯 $SPY / $NVDA https://t.co/S2VxNqiiKQ$NVDA は勿論凄いのだけど、 $SMCI のほうがヤバいね。持ってないけど。我的 $NVDA 接近+88%了，目前也不會有賣出它，改買 $TSLA 的想法，因為前年我這麼做了，結果錯了。

特斯拉現在是底部進行中，沒有激情，所以許多人賣掉改買有速度的 $NVDA ，也沒有甚麼錯。

兩家都是頂級企業，都值得持有。$SPY Going against the market trend is like that naive swimmer going against the current. Shorting market when every dip is getting bought 
$NVDA $SMCI shorts 

@ripster47 says trend is your friendMy stomach churns for the poor fuckers that are buying $nvda and $smci up here. I’d offer some lube but I don’t think it will help.While $NVDA is contributing almost 1/4 of the gain in $SPX today, 76% of large cap stocks are higher on the day and that number has improved since the open, which is a positive sign.Too bad didn’t go into $CRSP like I thought of for 10% $NVDA up 14% but the pricey contracts I let scare me away@charliekirk11 The event will be a severe stock market rebalancing. A jostling of the haves and have-nots, if you will. Banks are fearful and IBS is stoic but speaking. 1 quadrillion derivatives and rising interest rates? NVDA tricks. Good luck everyone.@Awakene70440226 A bit aggressive there son,  especially with nothing to back your PT $clsk $wulf $nvdaFor a while I thought an AI top might be like crypto. Smaller names make big speculative booms and start to crash. Bigger names sell off but spike highs before topping. 

This is one of the reasons I like shorting the NVDA gap to ATH.it's Jensen Huang's world &amp; we're just living in it.

$NVDA is larger than most economies of entire countries and it ran up 20% yesterday and 16% today - wild 😂

this is wilder than ANY Crypto run-up because of the sheer size &amp; volume. Hope you understand how crazy this is! https://t.co/kdUdCabBZA@garyblack00 Any Tesla with fsd has no competition period. Fsd is the best AI product in the universe. How many days do I have to watch NVDA up 100, SMCI up 240, Tesla down. Give out FSD 1 year free. Your target is Porshe, Mercedez, BMW, Audi, Subaru, Rivian. New owners will never give it up@JackFarley96 Jack, don't you think NVDA loaning money to companies in order to buy their own chips might be something like "fiber swapping?"

$NVDA is selling capital goods in conditions of both scarcity and monopoly which won't last. 

In the future there will be a drop in quantity, prices and margins of these goods sold. Only now, nobody cares about any futureToday $NVDA has reached a valuation of $1.91T, more than $GOOGL ($1.79T) and $AMZN ($1.80T). More than $TSLA and $META combined ($0.62T+$1.24T).@ 1.84 🍎 BANGER!!!🚨📈

Congrats to @nvidia ; truly an inspiration!Nvidia surprised Wall Street yet again. Then, a broad stock market rally ensued, with both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow hitting new record closes while AI stocks also caught another bid.

Yet here we are, up 3-4x on a a tiny sum, kicking my past selfNo final das contas, tudo irá depender da empresa conseguir cumprir as expectativas do mercado para o crescimento de receitas e lucros.

E você, qual a sua expectativa para a Nvidia no longo prazo?Nvidia makes Wall Street history as stock surge adds $277 billion in market cap https://t.co/97RDE3LE3cO detalhe é que estamos apenas no princípio de uma enorme curva de crescimento das IAs.

Algumas estimativas falam em uma alta de 10 vezes na demanda por esses chips até 2027. 

E a Nvidia dá sinais de que continuará dominando esse mercado em um futuro próximo.Hoje o negócio está radicalmente diferente, com 80% da receita vindo de GPUs para data centers.

E o destaque destes últimos anos está na produção de chips para o treinamento de modelos de Inteligência Artificial (IAs).

A Nvidia domina impressionantes 80% deste mercado.“Mas Bruno, o que a Nvidia fez para multiplicar sua receita por 5 e os lucros por 7 vezes? Isso pode continuar no futuro?”

Cinco anos atrás, mais da metade da receita da empresa vinha do setor de games, enquanto o de data center representava 25%.Um investimento de R$ 1.000 em ações da Nvidia, feito 5 anos atrás, hoje valeria R$ 25.800 (já considerando a valorização do dólar).

Isso representa um retorno de impressionantes 2.580%, ou 93% ao ano. 

Mas qual é o motivo para esse salto de valor? Vou avaliar alguns números.#Palantir Mr +#Nvidia omniverse 🙏

$pltr $nvda@rominrx @recoma @_ffferreira As 3 empresas mais pika desse setor então são AMD, TSM e NVIDIA? dá pra fazer uma conta então de mercado endereçável e, caso não ocorra uma tragédia nas margens, comprando um pouco das 3 não daria pra perder muito dinheiro no longo prazo, certo?5 anos atrás, 1 Bitcoin custava R$ 14 mil. Estava praticamente na mínima daquele inverno cripto.

Desde então, teve uma multiplicação de quase 18 vezes em reais.

Mas se você apostou no Bitcoin, errou. Nvidia subiu quase 26 vezes (em reais) no mesmo período.2/23(金)、先物ナイト終了

As of 02/22/24 01:50 PM EST@mattgaetz I own nvidia for the same reason Pelosi does. It’s a good performing stock. My broker recommends it. 

Seems like you’re jealous or something. Tool.@Finance_Ryan1 I think there can likely be a 50% correction in 6 month to a year. Who knows the exact time frame, but I do think it’s an amazing business with amazing execution.

I’d look to buy on a correction like that (which isn’t out of the norm for Nvidia). Most my shares are from 2018, so@KPITALISME NVidia fait la 🥳.
